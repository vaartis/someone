* Day 1
** Prologue
   Hello? Can you hear me?

   Uh.. Yes? I think.. Who are you and where am I?

   I'm the <narrator>, and we're.. here, in this empty room.

   <You are standing in an empty gray room, next to <narrator>>

   <Environment: [[./resources/sprites/environments/gray_room.png]]>

   <p>: What is this..?

   The remains of the world that was, until all that was left was.. this single gray room. And who are you, anyway?

   I.. don't know? I can't remember anything..

   Well.. maybe you can remember your name, at least?

   Not really.. i suppose <p> would be fine for now, until I figure things out.

   Alright, <p> it is.

   So.. where's the rest of the world?

   I don't know. But you might be able to help me with that.

   Me, how'd I do that?

   You look awfully familliar, say, are you by any chance not actually standing here with me right now, but sitting
   in front of a computer?

   Now that you mention it.. Yeah, i do..
   <The background becomes a screen frame instead of just white>
** First time in the room :walking:
   There's a room where the player is in. The player is some ambigous figure in a hoodie.

   The room around the player is badly lit, there's a lever on the wall on the right, while the wall on the left is the wall where the computer
   is. When the player presses the lever, a sound is heard from the computer. The player then goes back to the computer.
** The walk through the forest to the village
   <Environment: [[./resources/sprites/environments/midnight_forest.png]]>

   <You're no longer standing in the room, now around you is a midnight forest>

   <p> What.. what happened to the room?

   <narrator>: Well, you did something, and now there's the forest. That is what i was talking about when I told you about the rest of the world. This forest is
   a fraction of it. This is where we all woke up.

   What do you mean "we all"? There are more people here?

   There were. I don't know if they're still here. It's been some time since there was anything here. But now you're here at least. And the forest is
   back too.

   Then what do you mean by "woke up"?

   We all found ourselves here just like you did, with no memory of what happened or who we are. When I found myself here, there was nobody else
   around. It was pretty lonely, the only thing I would do is walk through the forest, looking around for anything to do at all. With time though, more
   people came, just like me, with no memories about anything before the moment they woke up. They found themselves in this very forest. They went
   looking for something to do, like i did, and eventually met the others. There were all kinds of creatures appearing, too. Some of them were very
   much sentient, like me and you, some were more animal-like, just following instincts. What seemed to connect them was that they all were just as
   confused.

   And then.. could you elaborate on what happened? Where did everyone go?

   Something. I'm not sure what exactly happened, but it seemed like the world was being cut off piece by piece. One day, there appeared a wall at the
   edge of the forest. A wall that looked just like those in the room we were just in. Just a gray wall that seemed to extend in all directions. The
   next day the wall grew closer. People were scared. Long story short, eventually the whole world shrank to a single room. I don't know were the
   other people went, i haven't seen them in a while. I have no idea how much time i've been in that gray room, alone. But now you're here, and that
   probably means something is happening..  Now, could we go for a walk at least? I've been on this same spot for so long it feels like forever. I'd
   like to at least take a stroll through the forest while we can.

   Sure, there's no point in staying here anyway.

   <You walk through the forest you are now in. It's not very thick, but there is still plenty of plants and trees. Although all of them look somewhat
   similiar with small variation>

   <p>: So.. what was life like here, anyway? Until everything diasppeared, that is..

   Oh you know, pretty peaceful. It's not like we had any specific needs to have fights for. I'd say just your usual life, but i can't really judge
   fairly what usual life is like, because i've only ever known my own life here...

   True... I still want to know though.

   Well, after some time spent just going around the forest and finding other people, we decided to settle down somewhere. This is where we're
   currently heading, or so i hope, since i havn't seen this forest for such a long time. For some reason, there were some people that knew how to make
   "instruments", while others didn't. They couldn't explain where they obtained this knowledge, it's like it just appread in their heads when the need
   arose. These people would make these simple instruments from what was in the forest. It looked like they were just smashing things together and then
   the tools just appeared in their hands. Others tried to do this too, but would not succeed. Then the instruments were used to chop down the trees,
   uproot stumps, and build from that. Other people knew how to make dyes from flowers and other plants. They did it the same way others made
   tools. The first houses were pretty simple, but of course, as time went on people would make them more sophisticated and fancy, to stand out
   more. Eventually we learned how to make other things, too. Some people, who were not able to create anything by hand, would create for the sake of
   entertainment, some created paintring, others would use paper and black dyes to to write tales and stories. Some volunteered to document the history
   of what was happening around them, and with those people the libraries appeared. They'd organize their document history in books and store them all
   in one place. Sounds pretty cool, right?

   Yeah, that's useful, probably?

   Maybe for the new people that come like you it would be. People here don't age, they were all around for as long as i can remember, until what
   happened happened and they were all gone. Anway, after sometime fire was discovered and the first library burnt down with most of the books in
   it. Some were rewritten from memory after that, but many were gone forever.

   Oh.

   Indeed. So the next library was built out of stone. Not long after that concrete was discovered by accident. Same happened with glass. Fast forward
   some time, and the village wasn't the only place where people lived, a city was built, and it was big, with asphalt roads and tall buildings. People
   would come up with different work for themselves to spend time. Now they were trying to understand the world itself. Trying to find out how things
   work. Eventually, a person showed up. They didn't name themselves, but claimed to be the creator of this world. They moved rather unnaturally, as if
   controlled by strings by strings. They told the researchers about the world about how that person watched them grow and that now they had come to
   them in person. A bit after that, the "creator" disappeared, and then the thing happened, the world was vanishing. Panic. And then everything ceased
   to be. Except me. I was still there, for some reason.

   That is one crazy story.. but i have no choice except to belive it. I have no idea what i am doing here exactly, so might as well take some
   explanation for granted, you really now a lot more about things than I do. Oh and by the way, you so confidently asked me if i'm sitting in front
   of a computer screen, how come you were so certain?

   There's something in the way you move that gives it away, it's a bit similiar to how the "creator" was. It might just be my imagination, I really
   wanted to belive that you had something in common with them, and it turned out you did. Anyway, we're there. This is the place where i used to live.

   <You see something reminiscent of a village. There are a lot of cottages of all shapes and colors. No living creature seems to be around except the
   two of you. All the windows are dark, too. There is a central road around which all the houses seem to have been built. Or rather, probably, the
   road was made to connect the first houses and then the others were built along it.>

   <narrator>: My house is the one on the edge of the road. Since my house was one of the early ones, it was built on the current outskirts of the
   village and I never really had any reason to move. The road was made a long time after it was built, connecting my house and the house of a friend
   of mine first, and then extending into the village.

   <You come to the house <narrator> was talking about. The door is not locked, the <narrator> just opens it>

** Narrator's house
   <narrator>: We didn't really need any locks on the doors, at least here in the village, not like there was anything to steal that the people
   couldn't easily make for you if you asked nicely.

   <The <narrator> finds the light switch on the left and turns the lights on.>

   <narrator>: Surprisingly, the light still works, too. And don't ask how we got electricity here, i don't quite understand it myself.

   Yeah, alright, Maybe i'll ask someone else who might know, if there ever comes someone else besides the two of us.

   Sure, I knew some people who could explain it, but I don't know if we'll ever be able to see them, or if anyone comes back at all. Anyway. I'm
   really tired from all this walking, spending your time in an empty room for so long doesn't motivate one to move much. So.. there's only one bed and
   we'll have to share it, since i never bothered with a second one, nobody stayed for the night here, probably because everyone lived so close
   together. You can check out the rest of the house if you want, since you'll probably be spending some time here.

   Check out the..
   - Living room :: You check out the living room. It's decently sized and has a sofa in it. On the opposite side of the room there are several
                    bookshelves packed with various books. Some of the names that stand out are "The history of everything" and "How the world works,
                    as explained by its creator". On the other side of the shelf, there are several books that seem to be about the different
                    philosophical traditions of this world. There's also something resembling a computer on the table nearby, but you decide not to
                    touch it for now. The window in the room faces the other house that stands nearby. There's not much else in this room.
                    # Set want to talk about the computers
   - Kitchen :: The kitchen is not very big, there are a few cupboards that have dishes in them, other have some of the plants you've seen earlier, but
                dried. Most of the food on the kitchen seems to be plant-based, except in the fridge there's something that looks like milk, but you
                decide not to taste it, since it's not your house. Maybe you should inquire the <narrator> about the food in this world later. Other
                than all the storage places on the kitchen, there's a table with a few chairs and a window that faces the forest you just came from.
                # Set want to talk about plant based food
   - Bathroom :: On the left, there's a moderately sized bathtub, near which there's a small shelf with some kind of soap looking thing and a
                 washcloth. On the right, a small sink stands, with its own bar of soap. There's also a very small window near the ceiling, you can
                 only see the dark sky through it. Unlike in the room you just came from, the bathroom's floor and walls are made of stone-looking
                 tiles, not wood. You decide to check if the sink works, and sure enough it does. At first the water is very cold, but you figure out
                 the turning the knob on the faucet makes it warm or even hot. You wash your hands using the soap bar, it feels pretty nice.
   - Go the bed (=>)

   You go to the bedroom, it's not too big, there are two cupboards on both sides of the bed.

   - IF explored at least one room :: The <narrator> is already asleep. You say "good night" to yourself, although you're not sure what will happen
        when you fall asleep, since you don't seem to belong to this world, unlike the <narrator> who is fast asleep
        already.
   - ELSE ::  Sure, yeah, i'm getting tired too. Although i'm not sure what happens when i'll go to bed, since it seems like i'm not exactly here like you are.

             I suppose we'll just have to see for ourselves.

             <You both lie down.>

             <narrator>: Good night.

             You too.

   <The screen goes black>
* Day 2
** The first night :walking:
   After the screen goes black, the player is back in the dark room they were in and can explore a little more. There's a new doorway that appeared
   and that the player can go through. It is as badly lit as the room and has a simple puzzle with three switches that need to be pressed in a certain
   order or something similiar (TBD). After that a sound is heard and the player goes back to the computer. It's now the next day.
** Morning, setting out for the road
   <It seems like it's already morning and the <narrator> is already out somewhere. After a bit of searching you find them in the kitchen having
   breakfast>.

   <narrator>: Hey. Mornin'

   Yeah.. Morning

   Slept well?

   Not really. When i "went to sleep" the screen went black and i was unable to do anything. So i figured i'll go look around again. Unsurprisingly,
   there was a new place to look at. Nothing too interesting though, a very basic puzzle, if you can even call it that. I wonder why it was
   there. But when i activated it, something happened, i guess?  There was some kind of sound. And then i went back to the computer and it was
   already morning.

   Interesting.. As for me, i slept in an actual bed this time, haven't done that in a while.

   No bed here in the room i'm in. It's quite empty actually.

   Could you elaborate?

   Not much to say. It's just me and a table with the computer. Well, there's this new hallway, but it's pretty empty too. There really isn't
   anything of interest here besides the computer. Which is also the only source of light here, it seems. Otherwise it's dark as hell.

   Scary.

   I dunno.. Didn't really think about that until now. Well, at least I'm pretty sure there's nobody else here, there's simply no place to hide in
   the two empty rooms, and the screen of this computer is taking care of darkness around too. It's not that bright, but it's something. Let's see if
   I can find something to brighten this place up in the future.

   Yeah, even if you aren't afraid, sitting in the darkness doesn't do you any good.

   Anyway, what is this you're having for breakfast?

   <The <narrator> seems to have something that looks like cereal with milk in the bowl>

   The liquid in the bowl is a product of soaking and grinding a plant that grows in a region far from here. The region and the plant were discovered in an expedition to a
   place outside the known land of that time. When they were there, they discovered a different biome, a colder one. They told that it was a bit more
   chilly out there and that the plants and trees there were different. They took some samples back, then the local people discovered various
   applications for them. One of which was to use them as food, because of their taste. You see, we don't really need food to survive. We don't feel
   hunger. But we do feel the taste, and that is what food is used here for. To satisfy one's curiosity in new tastes and to feel good after an
   interesting meal. Wanna check it out?

   <The narrator passes you a carton>

   Yeah, i'm curious how it tastes now.

   <You take a sip. It tastes like milk with a slight bit of grass>

   <p>: This taste reminds me of a certain drink i know about for some reason. This seems to be a reoccuring pattern, too..  I know about something,
   but i can't remember where i got that knowledge from.

   That's.. unusual. I felt like this too, but when the "creator" came and told us how this world came to be, it became ovious.

   Well, that doesn't really work in my case, since i'm here and you're there, does it?

   Indeed. You'll have to figure it out in some other way.

   So.. What about the other part of your meal?

   Oh, it's the leaves of a bush growing around, people have been using it as food for a long time. When dried, it changes its taste, and some people
   like it more in that state. I do, for example. Do you wish to taste this too?

   Since we're on it, yeah i'll take a bite.

   <You take a few from the box and taste them. It's really just dried leaves>

   Uh i dunno about this one. Really, it tastes like leaves.

   That's because they are leaves?

   Yeah. I just thought it'd be something more surprising.

   Sorry to disappoint! I like it, though. Now, let me finish my breakfast and we'll go take a stroll outside.

   Sure, take you time.

   <You spend a few minutes in the kitchen while the <narrator> finishes their breakfast>

   <narrator>: Well, i'm done.. Let's go.

   <You go outside. The <narrator> turns the lights off as they close the door. They then look somewhere behind you with a confused look>.

   <narrator>: Ah. This wasn't here yesterday. Might be the result of you solving that "puzzle" you talked about yesterday.

   <You turn around and see that in the distance, there are now tall buildings>

   <p> So this is the city you talked about yesterday?

   It seems like that's the one. Indeed.

   So, now we'll go check it out, right?

   If you insist. It's going to be a long walk though.

   It's not like we're short on time.. If I were to describe how much time we have, I'd say we've got all of it. Besides, not like there's anything
   else to do. Boredom really is a big problem around here..

   Oh yes, it very much is. So, there was a stone pathway that leads from here to the city. It was layed a bit after the city was started, before the
   tall buildings were there to help people find where the city was. Let's see if we can find it..

   <After a short walk you find the stone road on the other side of the village>

   <narrator>: Here it is. Let's go here, then. It's far more comfortable to walk on the road instead of going through the bushes and grass.

   Yeah. Getting through that forest yesterday was no fun. Well, the getting throught the forest part was no fun, but listening you talk about the
   world was alright. So i guess i'll get to have more of that but without the no fun part.
** The long walk questions
   Sure. What do you want to talk about?

*** IF (want to talk about the computers) THEN the computers here, what are they like and how do they work?
     So.. You have computers here? How do they actually work?

     Yes! I actually have one, too. You might've seen it in my living room. I got it recenly, if you don't count all the time i've spent alone in that
     empty room alone.  I used to have a big one, until it eventually broke down, just refused to boot.. So i got a new one. Couldn't really get the
     same one, since they didn't make them like that anymore.  So i got a new shiny slick one. It was faster, but i really don't use it much. I'm not
     very good with computers, you see. Checking mail, reading people's blogs and writing in my own blog was good enough for me. We had a network that
     connected all computers together, but once again, i have no idea how it works, so you'll have to ask someone else about that, provided we ever
     find anyone else..

     You have a blog? What is it about?

     Oh all the things. It's more like a micro-blog, you know? Where you put all the things that are happening to you right now. And check what other
     people are doing. It's pretty fun. That way it's easier to keep up with your friends even when they move. I was really happy when i was told
     about it, and that people i wanted to keep talking with were on there. So i started using it a lot. Of course, now that everyone's gone, there is
     probably nobody on there..  We could still check it later when we get back. Or maybe we could find some kind of computer cafe in the city.

     Yeah, for sure. I wanna see it.
*** IF (want to talk about plant based food) THEN What's with the food here, it's all made from plants?
     <p>: It seems like all the food is made out of various plants. Do all people here only eat that?

     Yes? Well, we wouldn't eat each other, would we?

     Fair.. Here we have other foods, which are made of various creatures that are deemed not self-aware. People would raise them specifically to cook
     them later. I can't remember why i do, but i know that it exists and how it happens..

     That sounds pretty awful.

     It does, kind of. But these creatures live their best lives before they are made into food. They're well fed and cleaned. I can't say I'm too
     much against that, especially if they really don't even recognize themselves, just follow the instincts.

     While i can understand that, we never really sank that low as to abuse the less aware creatures.

     Yeah, I guess some of the reasoning for that would be that people in your world don't actually need to eat to survive. Eating other creatures
     gives way more nutrients. Maybe that was the main reason people eat them: to survive the tougher times. I'm sure there are people out there that
     still only eat plant-based foods like you here do.

     Requiring food to survive indeed makes it a lot more difficult, it does make sense that people would use any means necessary to survive of
     course. Still, I'm glad that for us this problem never existed and we could circumvent it entirely and don't have a dire need to abuse creatures
     to survive and it makes me feel unwell that this had to happen in your case.

     Again, surely there must be other people that feel like you out there. Although i bet the opposite is also true, there might be people that enjoy
     it.

     What an awful world that must be. Still, surely, not all hope is lost if someone understand that it's bad.

     I suppose that's just how it is. The world is cruel like that sometimes.
*** Do people always look the same since they don't age?
     <p>: So.. if people here don't age, does that mean their appearance doesn't change since when they first find themselves here?

     Pretty much. Since i woke up here my appearance didn't change at all. The hair and the nails still grow, but that's practically it.  So i still
     have to look after them, but except that.. not much changes. You can get new clothes to change your looks a bit, certainly, but other than that
     the looks don't change too much. Some people actually wondered if anything could be done about that, but the research was started relatively late
     and didn't go that far.

     I see.. So after people wake up here, they are all already aged and that never changes. Were all people here grown-ups?

     Not all of them, no. The "age" ranged considerably, there were all kinds of people. You couldn't really judge anyone by their appearance, because
     someone could look like a child, but have lived a long life already. Perhaps, we could talk to the people who did research on the topic, provided
     we'd find someone like that. Maybe in the city, since most of them lived there, it was the place for researchers to gather.
*** What's the city like in general?
     <p>: What's the city we're heading to like in general?

     Uhm.. It's big! And it had a lot of people doing many things. A lot bigger than the village, you know. The buildings there were also actually
     built in places regions designated for them, unlike in our village, where things were just made up as the time progressed and then were connected
     with a road. For the city, they actually planned areas for houses and for service and entertainment buildings, which where then built there
     gradually as the amount of people and idea of what to build raised. In the housing areas, the houses were made with multiple floors and flats, to
     allow more people to live in those houses; and in the center of the city there is a lot less of housing and a lot more of the fun stuff like
     clubs, cafes, restaurants. Plus, since the city is so big there are also means of easier transportation between the parts of the city. Although
     they wouldn't help us since they require someone to operate them and I sure as hell have no idea how to do it. We can probably see some of them
     though, or at least i hope we can.

     Interesting.. so, it's big, that's not really new.. What about nighttime, how's it at night?

     It'd be all lit up if there were people, night life there is a normal thing there, unlike in the village where we mostly go to bed and get up
     early; in the city, many people are more active at night, just because of the way they made their schedule; there are entertainment places where
     they go to meet their friends and make new ones, have a drink, dance. I tried that lifestyle for some time when i was in the city but i really
     just couldn't handle it, I think it takes a lot of time to get used to it; getting up so late just feels wrong.. and staying up after midnight is
     just too tiring for me..
*** Is the food in the city any different?
     <p>: Since the city is so big, they probably have some interesting different cuisine, right?

     Precicely so. The food there is made of things delivered there from different places. Since they don't have much of their own food growing, they
     have to import it from all the places around the world, while the rest of the world gets the "techonolgy" pieces from them, like computers and
     phones. As a consequence, you can also get food from other parts of the world there for yourself if you go to the city. The milk i had for
     you saw this morning, for example, i got from my last trip to the city. I try all kinds of food there and those i like i take back with
     me to enjoy at home.

     Wait.. Just to be clear, do you mean the thing you had with dried leaves is called milk?

     Yeah. That's what it's called.

     Huh.. I wonder about the origins of that name.

     No idea, really. I just used the name the people gave it, i weren't the one who made it up or anything.

     I see.. i guess it's the only kind of milk you've ever seen so there's no need to add anything to it's name.

     It's not really the ONLY one. There are kinds made from other things. It's just that since this one was discovered first, it got the name,
     and only after that did people tried experimenting with other things. Not all of those experiments were that successful..

     # Set want to talk about plant based food AND want to talk about the computers UNLESS already talked about them
*** Are we going to stay in the city for the night?
     Are we gonna stay in the city this night? Do you know anywhere to stay in case we have to?

     I hope we won't have to.. We got up pretty early and the day is still young, so there's a good chance we won't.  Still, if we have to, we'll
     probably be able to stay at some kind of hotel, especially if there's nobody else there besides us. There are a few of those in the city, so
     finding one wouldn't be a problem. They were made especially for people like us, who come to the city for a short time and don't have any other
     place to stay at.

     Pretty convinient.. So finding where to stay for the night, if we need to, shouldn't be a problem. Got it.
** The city
   <Finally, after the long walk, you arrive at the city. Judging by the position of the sun, it's somewhere around noon. The stone road you've been
   walking gradually changes to asphalt>

   <narrator>: We're here, finally! That was hell of a walk. I guess we could just keep going on the road and not the sidewalk, since, presumably,
   there's no transport on the roads right now.. We're in the suburbs currenly, so the buildings here aren't as big and are mostly houses, not some
   services or entertainment ones.

   Yeah.. These look smaller compared to those in the distance. Are we heading deeper into the city?

   I'd say we should check a few houses first, to see if anyone's there. The chance is small but that's the main point why we're here: to try to find
   someone else besides us..

   OK, gotcha. So, are we gonna split and just go check a few houses here and there?

   I'd really rather not split. I'm afraid that something might go wrong, like you'd get lost, and i'll be left alone again.

   Understandable. We'll check some houses together then.

   <Both of you go off the road, to the first house on the right, going up a stairway to the first floor>

   <narrator>: Let's check the doors on this floor..

   <The <narrator> comes to the first door and carefully turns the knob. The door is not locked. The <narrator> looks at you somewhat worryingly>

   <narrator>: So.. should we go in?

   That's what we're here for, right?

   Yeah.. right..
*** Flat on the first floor
   <The <narrator> goes through the door and you go after. You're now in the first flat on the first floor. It's not very big: there's what seems to
   be a bathroom, and the living room and the kitchen are made into a single room, with a kitchen counter inbetween them. The living room part has a
   sofa and a small coffee table. There's a laptop on the table.>
*** Check the laptop
     <player> Should we.. check the laptop?

     I'm.. not sure. It's somebode else's! That'd be kinda rude..

     Well it's not like we're gonna go snooping around too much in there. Let's just see if there's anything that can help us "on the surface",
     alright?

     OK.. I guess that's fine..

     <You come up to the laptop and press the spacebar key. The laptop wakes up. The screen is locked, but there's no password, you just click the log
     in button and it does so. The only window on the computer seems to be a blog, you assume, on the same platform the <narrator> talked about
     before. The top post says "Just got some new flavored noodles, gonna check em out soon", underneath the text it says "posted undefined ago">

     <p>: Is that the blogging thing you told me about?

     Yes.. Well, the interface looks like it, at least.. The date of the post says "undefined" ago, but what does that mean? And, looking at it, other
     posts' dates are like that too.

     No idea! It wasn't able to determine the date, obviously, but what that actually means I don't know. Probably not much else to see here, since
     this is the only window on the computer, it was probably only used for writing on the blog.
*** Check the kitchen part of the room
     <You walk up to the fridge and open it. There's a bunch of different foods in there, some in bags, most unopened at all>

     <narrator>: So many interesting kinds of meals could be made from this.. But I wouldn't dare to touch someone else's supplies. Maybe we could
     take some from the city center when we're there. That's where i'd usually get all the cooking stuff.
*** Check the bathroom
     <You open the bathroom door and turn on the light. It blinks a few times at first, and then stays on as it should. The bathroom is mostly the
     same as the <narrator>'s, maybe even a little smaller.>

     <p>: Not much to see here.. Good thing we checked, anyway.
*** Leave the first flat
   <p>: Not much else to look at here. Should we go check out the other flats?

   Yea. Nothing more catches the eye here.

   <You leave the flat. The <narrator> closes the door, leaving it as it was when you arrived>

   <narrator>: Let's check the other flats, then.

   <You nod. The <narrator> come to the opposite side of the corridor and turns the knob. The door is locked>

   <narrator>: Interesting.. So, the person who lived in that flat just forgot to lock their door? And their computer didn't have any password,
   too. Guess someone didn't really care about invaders at all.

   Means they had nothing to hide, right?

   Not sure about that. But we can assume that for now.

   <You check the other floors, all the doors are locked. Same happens in the adjacent house>

   <narrator>: Seems like we just got lucky with that one.. All the others are probably locked, too. Let's head into the city and see what's up
   there.

   Agreed. This was getting boring anyway. You come up to the door and you just know it's locked, but you still try, with no luck. That first one was
   a big surprise.

   <You head into the city, going along the road, past all the same-looking houses. After some time, you reach the center part of the city, where all
   the night and day life happened>

   <narrator>: Never seen these streets so empty, it was bright and full of people even at night. Not anymore. Didn't think they'd ever end up like
   this. I hope they'll be the way they were before someday, even though i didn't like it at the time, it's sad to see them so devoid of life.

   <The <narrator> stops for a few second, looking at the building to the right>

   <narrator>: Let's go see this one. This club was a hugely popular place to hang out at night, i got invited to go there at night a few times, but
   after the first one i didn't want to go there any more at all, too crowded.

   Shouldn't it be closed though? It's day after all.

   They didn't close it for the day, it's just that there weren't a lot of people there. That was the sweet time for me to go enjoy a few drinks.
*** Club
   <You go throuth the glass doors of the parade entrance, then through the long hallway, and to the actual dancefloor and the bar.
   As expected, there's nobody there.>

*** The bar
     <You come over to the bar. There are a few drinks on the bar.>

     <p> Well, if nobody else is there, we might as well have them, right?

     Uh.. sure. The drinks here were nice after all. I missed them.

     <You sit on the stool and take one the glasses, then have a sip. It's very, very sweet and has a slight strawberry flavor>

     <p>: Yuck.. it's so sweet!

     Yes! This one was called "strawberry boom", because it's so sweet. But the aftertaste is nice.

     Actually.. it kinda is.. huh

     The one i have here is a mix of milk and various syrops. It's not exactly a thing you'd get at the club, more like a coctail. Wanna try it?

     Alright.. here goes.

     <You take a sip of the coctail. It is, indeed, a mixture of milk and various sweet syrops, although the which exact ones you can't quite figure
     out>

     Eh.. It is as you described, i don't know if i like it.

     Well. To each their own. Let's finish those and continue our "investigation"

     Yeah. Investigatin'
*** The dance floor
     <The tiles of the dance floor don't change colors. It seems like the program that controls them doesn't run during the day.  There are a few
     tables around it, one of which has a small white pack of someting, with "6" written on it.>

     <p>: Any idea what this pack is?

     Oh that one.. It's probably the popular bubble-gum. Yeah it's called "6". Because there are 6 of them in the pack.

     <You come up to the table and peek into the pack. There are 5 strips of gum in there.

     <p>: Five. They left an almost full pack here. How unthoughtful.

     Maybe someone didn't like 'em. They don't exactly taste like.. anything. Just dull.

     Not too fancy of a gum, eh?

     Yep. It's very basic. If you want to just chew on something, maybe, or have no time to brush your teeth at all, although.. I'm not sure it helps
     with that?
*** Mall and the way back
   <narrator>: That was a whole bunch of nothing, huh? I'm getting really desperate for something to change already! Come on..  Did we go all the
   way for nothing?

   Yeah.. Jeez. So boring! Maybe we should head back already?

   Come on, let's check a few more places, OK? And on our way, let's try to find a few bicycles to go back on, that should ease our way a bit.

   Oh, sure.. If you know where to get them.

   Yeah. We'll head for the big mall for now, there's a bike place there, i hope nobody is going to mind if we take them?

   There's probably nobody to do so..

   Yes. That's what i'm talking about. Let's go.

   <You walk for bit more deeper into the city, until you see the big mall building. You know it's a mall because it has "City Mall" written on
   it. Who could've thought>

   <narrator>: I'll try to remember where exactly the bike place is, while you look around and see if there's anything interesting while we're on
   the way. This place is pretty big after all.

   <While you go, you notice a few clothing places, cosmetics stuff, lingerie, a huge food section, general applience stuff, and then, finlly,
   you're at the bike place>

   Well, just take the first one that fits you and let's go already.

   <The <narrator> tries out a few bikes, stopping on a sporty looking green one. You grab the first one you see, the seat feels alright and the
   pedals are at the comfortable height, so you don't hesitate too much. Your bike is red, the fastest color. You set out on your way back
   immediately. The sun seems to already be setting.  Just how much have you been walking here?>

   <narrator>: What a disappointment. Not like it really matters, since the time is not a constraint, but still, having no results is
   disappointing. Now we know there's probably nothing there, at least, so we wouldn't need to go all the way back again for a while.

   I guess that's true.. That wasn't very exciting, except when we actually did find something, you know?

   Not a lot of that, but yes..
** Back in the village
   <After the back, you spend most of the time focusing on the road. The bikes make the journey quite a bit shorter. When you arrive, almost set and
   it's pretty dark. On your way to <narrator>'s house you suddenly notice that the house on opposite side of the street has its lights turned
   on. You look at the <narrator>. The <narrator> looks at you>

   <narrator>: What the hell?! Is he.. actually in here?

   Is this your friend's house?

   Yes! Oh wow, can it be that he's somehow back? That we aren't alone here? We have to check RIGHT NOW.

   <You both abandon the bikes in the middle of the road and run up to the house. The <narrator> knocks on the door a few times and carefully opens
   it>

   <narrator>: Hey?

   <Behind the door, you see a guy, not too tall, with shoulder length black hair and wearing glasses. He jumps back, producing a high-pitched yell>

   <maj>: aaHHH!!

   <You see <narrator> giggle a little>

   <narrator>: Maj! Long time no see!!

   # Possible names: Rüd, Maj, Jörg?

   <maj>: Ah.. ha.. Not sure about the time, but hi! I'm really lost.. since everything went down i can't remember much.. The panic, then darkness,
   and then i wake up in the forest this morning, in the same place i was the first time. I didn't understand anything, so i thought i'd just head
   back home, what else could i do? So I there i was, alone.. Which was scary.. so i just spent the whole day at home..

   <narrator>: Oh wow.. That's a bit different.. but.. uh.. let's come in and not just stand here, eh?

   <maj>: Ohh.. yeah! sure.. and who's the person behind you might be..? if you don't mind me asking..

   <narratoro>: Ah, that's <p>. They're.. uh.. new here. Apparently they're from the "outside", like the "creator" was..

   <maj>: Wow! i never thought i'd meet someone like that ever again..

   <p>: Hello! While i suppose it's true i'm from the "outside" I don't really know anything about that person you refer to as the "creator", nor do
   I know anything about myself.. or anything outside the room i'm in, really..

   <maj>: Oh wow.. shame.. but still, welcome! let's head into the kitchen and have some tea at least, like the <narrator> suggested, we shouldn't
   just stand in the doors.

   <You all head to a room on the left, it's a medium-sized kitchen. You and <narrator> sit at the table, while Maj puts some water into the
   electric kettle, the water boils rather fast, and after a minute you all sit at the table with some tea, which is still too hot to taste, but
   already smells minty>

   <maj>: So, <narrator>, what about time that you wanted to say, what was so different?

   <narrator>: You said that you only remember darkness and then you woke up back in the forest, but it was very different for me. It has actually
   been a very long wait for me.  All that was left of the world was a single room with gray walls, and nothing else, and that's where i was all
   that time. I'm a bit envious of you not having to experience that.  I never want to stay alone with nothing and nobody else but myself. I'm glad
   you're back too now, it's been about a day since the world has returned back to normal.. well.. except all the people. <p> helped me get out of
   that room by doing somethig on the outside. Something also changed this night, while I was asleep, isn't that right, <p>?

   <p>: Yeah.. There was some kind of a corridor, with a stupid puzzle. So i solved it, there was some kind of sound, and that somehow brought back
   the city. And you, too, it seems. I'm looking forward to more changes like that in the future.

   <maj>: Wow.. that is a lot to process.. First off, it's very sad you had to experience this, <narrator>.. But that's behind you now, and we can
   start living again, right?

   <narrator>: I.. sure hope so. There are still so many people missing.. But we'll try to get them back. We've been to the city with <p> today,
   it's as empty as everything else, so we really just wasted a lot of time.

   <maj>: Such a big city and nobody there too.. So we're the only people here..

   <narrator>: We haven't found anyone else.. But seeing you now makes me excited! More people might be coming back soon..

   <maj>: Oh i can't wait for that..! I really really want everyone to be back.. I already miss all the life around here..

   <narrator>: We'll be progressing with that soon, i hope. In the meantime, <p>, Maj was one of the people who designed the first computers around
   here!  So you can ask something about them..

   <p>: Oh!

   <maj>: Well.. i only participated in the initial design and development of the first ones, they were quite clumsy and big.. Nowadays computers
   are a lot more slim, all of that happened after they moved to the city, and i mostly resigned from duty and stayed here. We made the
   micro-blogging thing, i'm sure <narrator> told you about it, so we could keep each other up to date on things, so i still got the news about new
   inventions and research and even got to participate sometimes, but a lot of the time that still required being there in person, so it rarely
   happened.

   <p> Why didn't you want to go to the city with them and continue working on the cool stuff?

   <maj>: You see.. I really don't like big crowds of people and the city is ALL about that.. I get all anxious and trembly.. So I'd rather
   stay.. besides, the scientific community has grown a lot since the beginning and i'm sure they can go on without me.

   <narrator>: Don't you belittle your part in that community, you dummy! They wouldn't be able to make it like it is without your work, and you
   know it. You didn't really leave or anything, you still kept up with people from there, didn't you?

   <maj>: Yes.. ok, ok, you got me. I don't really like to admit it, because i'd sound like a hypocrit, though. But enough about that, there's
   another interesting thing: we designed the computers with long range networking in mind, and put some big servers in places where they'd be
   needed and where we could connect computers to them and then connect the server together. One of them is actually right here, in the basement of
   my house, I rarely go down there so it might be a bit dusty, but we can go see it if you want.

   <p>: Sure, i wanna see it.

   <Since you all are already done with the tea, you all stand up, and wait for Maj to lead the way. However, he just moves his chair and you notice
   that there's a trapdoor underneath. He lifts it, then reaches inside to find the light switch and turns it on. He then steps on the ledder there
   and starts going down. You look as he goes down, it's not that deep down there, just a few meters. He waves at you, telling you can go down
   now. You climb down the ladder first, then the <narrator> climbs in afterwards>

   <p>: You know.. this really looks like the room I am in. I mean, on the outside. Except yours is way better lit.

   <maj>: Do you really spend all your time in an almost empty concrete box? That's just sad.

   <p>: Not like i have any choice..

   <maj>: Anyway. Here it is, this big boy handles all the communication between the village and the city

   <You look at the server. It's a rack filled with all kinds of boxes and wires, all blinking with different colors>

   <maj>: In the city, there are a few of servers like this once, since it's a lot bigger. The city is like a hub for communication.

   <p>: I think I'm noticing a pattern here, same happens with the foods you guys have.

   <maj>: Precicely. I wasn't sure about how to use the basement for a while, but this thingy here fit in quite well, and now it doesn't take space
   in the house, plus it gets all the underground coolness.

   <p>: So it's not just me, it really is colder in here?

   <narrator>: I've noticed, too.

   <maj>: Yes! Besides being underground, this place is also additionally cooled down artificially. Otherwise it'd get pretty hot in here, this baby
   produces a lot of heat. There's not much to see other than the server, but i am proud of it and will take any opportunity to show this setup to
   someone, albeit it might sound like braggning, it did took some planning to set up. Now, let's get out of here, I'm feeling cold myself.

   <You all get out of the basement in the reverse order. Maj closes the trapdoor and moves his chair back>

   <maj>: Now, it's getting really late, i'd love to talk some more, but maybe we should continue tomorrow?

   <narrator>: I'm actually suddenly very tired, probably because the trip, I just realized it. Didn't notice at first because I was so excited to
   see you! We'll probably head back to my place then, <p> is staying at my house for now, until we figure out something better.

   <maj>: See you tomorrow, then!

   <p>: I wonder what'll happen tomorrow.. and how today's night will go. On my side, the the computer screen just goes black for a while.

   <maj>: We'll know sooner if we go to sleep sonner, haha.

   <p>: Yeah, good night!

   <You and the <narrator> leave the house and get back to the <narrator>'s place, <narrator> takes a shower, and you both head to bed>

   <narrator>: I'm exhausted.. Goodnight, i guess, even though it doesn't mean much for you apparently.

   <p>: I still appreciate the kind words. Let's see what tomorrow brings.

   <The <narrator> falls asleep very fast and your screen goes black again>
