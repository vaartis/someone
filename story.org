* Day 1
** Prologue
   Hello? Can you hear me?

   Uh.. Yes? I think.. Who are you and where am I?

   I'm Narra, and we're.. here, in this empty room.

   <You are standing in an empty gray room, next to her>

   <Environment: [[./resources/sprites/environments/gray_room.png]]>

   <p>: What is this place..?

   The remnants of the world that was, but all that's left of it now is this single room. And who are you, anyway?

   I.. don't know? I can't remember anything..

   Well.. maybe you can remember your name, at least?

   Not really.. i suppose <p> would be fine for now, until I figure things out.

   Alright, <p>.

   So.. where's the rest of the world?

   I don't know. But you might be able to help me with that.

   Me? How'd I do that?

   You look awfully familliar, say, are you by any chance not actually standing here with me right now, but sitting
   in front of a computer?

   Now that you mention it.. Yeah, i do..
   
   <The background becomes a screen frame instead of just white>

   <narra>: Try checking out your surroundings, maybe there's something obvious you can try?
** First time in the room :walking:
   There's a room where the player is in. The player is some ambigous figure in a hoodie.

   The room around the player is badly lit, there's a button on the wall on the right, while the wall on the left is the wall where the computer
   is. When the player presses the lever, a button is heard. The player then goes back to the computer.
** The walk through the forest to the village
   <Environment: [[./resources/sprites/environments/midnight_forest.png]]>

   <You're no longer standing in the room, now around you is a midnight forest>

   <p> What.. what happened to the room?

   <narra>: Well, you did something, right?
   
   Yeah. I did the most obvious thing: pressed the button that was the only other thing in the room except me and the computer.

   That was.. indeed a very obvious thing to do. Anyway, what lies before you is "the rest of the world". This is where we all woke up.

   So there are more people here?

   There were. But I'm not sure there's anyone else besides us right now. Well, at least I'm not alone anymore..

   Oh.. and what did you mean by "woke up"?

   We all found ourselves here just like you did, with no memory of what happened or who we are. When I found myself here, there was nobody else.  The
   only thing I would do is walk through this forest, looking around for anything to do. Somehow, with time, more people appeared, just like me, with
   no memories. They found themselves here. They went looking, like I did, and eventually met the others. There were other, more animal-like creatures
   appearing, less self-aware and more just following basic instincts. What seemed to connect everyone was that they all confused as to how they came
   here.

   And then.. Where did everyone go?

   Something happened. It seemed like the world was being cut off piece by piece. One day, walls appeared on the far parts of the world, just like you
   saw before. They seemed to extend in all direcitons. The next day the walls grew closer. People were scared. Long story short, eventually the whole
   world shrank to a single room. Don't know were the other people are now, haven't seen them in a while. I have no idea how much time I've spent
   alone in that room. But now you're here, and that probably means something is happening.. Now, would you mind if we go for a walk? I've been on
   this same spot for so long, it would be nice to at least take a stroll through the forest while we can.

   Sure, no point in staying here..

   <You walk through the forest. It's not very thick, but there are still plenty of plants and trees.>

   <p>: So.. what was life like here? Until everything diasppeared..
   
   Pretty simple. It's not like we had any specific needs to have fights for. I want to say just usual life, but I can't really judge fairly what
   usual life is like to anyone else, because I've only ever known my own life here...

   I don't think I have any idea how usual life is at all, so I'd like to hear how it was for you.

   Well, after some time spent just going around the forest and finding other people, we decided to settle down somewhere. Then, for some reason,
   there were some people that knew how to make "instruments", while others didn't. They couldn't explain why they knew it. These people would make
   simple instruments from what was around in the forest. It looked like they were just smashing things together and then the tools just appeared in
   their hands. Others tried to do this too, but couldn't do it. These instruments were used to clean out the forest and build simple houses. Other
   people knew how to make dyes from flowers and other plants. They did it the same way others made tools. As time went on people would make them more
   sophisticated and fancy, to stand out more, or brag to others, or just to spend time. Some people, who were not able to create anything by smashing
   stuff together, would draw paintings, others would use paper to to write down history and daily life stories. The library was built to store all
   the books that were written, all nicely placed on the shelves. And then the library burnt down by accident shortly thereafter. Sure the history
   books weren't all that useful, given that people here don't age, they were all around for as long as i can remember, until what happened happened
   and they were all gone. Still, many stories and hours of work were lost. They built the next library building out of stone.

   So many books gone.. I guess the people learned their lesson about building from wood, though.. At least nobody got hurt?

   A tragedy, but yes, nobody got hurt. After some time, the village wasn't the only place where people lived, there was a city, with asphalt roads
   and tall buildings. People would come up with all kinds of things to work on to spend time, fight the bordeom, understand how the world around
   is. Trying to find out how things work. Eventually, a person showed up. They didn't name themselves, but claimed to be the one who gave this world
   life. They moved unnaturally, as if controlled by strings. They told the people about the world, how they watched it grow and that they came to see
   it in person. A bit after that, the "creator" disappeared, and then it happened, the world vanished. Everything ceased to be. Except me. I was
   still here.

   I have no idea what I am doing here exactly, so thank you for clearing a few things about this world up a bit. Oh and by the way.. when you asked
   me if i'm sitting in front of a computer screen, how did you come up with that, what gave you the clue?

   There's something in the way you look and move that gives it away, it's a similiar to how the "creator" was. It might just be my imagination, I
   really wanted to belive that you had something in common with them, and it turned out you did. Anyway, we've arrived. This is the place where I
   used to live.

   <You see a village. There are a lot of houses of all shapes and colors. No living creature seems to be around except the two of you. All the
   windows are dark, too. There is a central road around which all the houses seem to have been built.>

   <narra>: My house is the one on the edge of the road. It was one of the early ones, built on what later became the outskirts of the village. The
   road was made a long time after it was built, connecting my house and the house of a friend of mine first, and then extending into the rest of the
   village.

   <You come to the house. The door is not locked, Narra just opens it.>
** Narra's house
   <She finds the light switch on the left and turns the lights on.>

   <narra>: Surprisingly, the light still works. And don't ask how, I don't quite understand it myself.

   Yeah, alright.

   I knew some people who could explain it, but I'm unsure we'll be able to meet them any time soon. Now, I'm really tired from all this walking,
   spending your time in an empty room for so long doesn't motivate to move much. So.. there's only one bed and we'll have to share it, I hope you're
   fine with that, thought it's not like you have a choice. You can check out the rest of the house if you want, you'll probably be spending some time
   here.

   Check out the..
   - Living room :: Decently sized, has a sofa in it. On the opposite side of the room there are several bookshelves packed with various books, from
                    titles you can guess some of them are probably scientific or philosophical. There's also something what seems to be a computer on
                    the table nearby, but you decide not to touch it for now. The window in the room faces the other house nearby.
                    # Set want to talk about the computers
   - Kitchen :: Not very big, there are a few cupboards that have dishes in them, others have some of the plants you've seen earlier, but dried. Most
                of the food on the kitchen seems to be plant-based, except in the fridge there's something that looks like milk, but you decide not to
                touch it, since it's not your house. Maybe you could inquire Narra about the food here later. Other than all the storage
                places on the kitchen, there's a table with a few chairs and a window that faces the forest you just came from.
                # Set want to talk about plant based food
   - Bathroom :: On the left, there's a moderately sized bathtub, near which there's a small shelf with some kind of soap and a sponge. On the right,
                 there's a a small sink, with its own bar of soap. There's also a very small window near the ceiling, you can only see the dark sky
                 through it. The bathroom floor and walls are made of stone-looking tiles, not wood, like the rest of the rooms. You check if the sink
                 works, and sure enough it does. At first the water is very cold, but turning the knob on the faucet makes it warm or even hot.
   - Go the bed (=>)

   - IF explored at least one room :: Narra is already asleep.
   - ELSE :: <narra>: Straight to bed, huh?
             
             Yeah.

             Oh well. Goodnight, then.

             You too.

   <You lie in bed fow a while, until eventually you fall asleep.>
   <The screen goes black>
* Day 2
** The first night :walking:
   After the screen goes black, the player is back in the dark room they were in and can explore a little more. There's a new doorway that appeared
   and that the player can go through. It is as badly lit as the room and has a simple puzzle with three buttons that need to be pressed in a certain
   order. After that a sound is heard and the player goes back to the computer. It's now the next day.
** Morning, setting out for the road
   <It seems like it's already morning and Narra is already out somewhere. After a bit of searching you find her in the kitchen having breakfast.>

   <narra>: Hey. Morning.

   Yeah..

   Slept well?

   Not really. When I "went to sleep" the screen went black and I was unable to do anything. So I figured I'll go look around again. Unsurprisingly,
   there was a new place to look at. Nothing too interesting though, three buttons that, when pressed so that they all become green, play a
   melody. And then I went back to the computer and it was already morning.

   Sounds like someone's playing with you.

   These buttons make no sense at all.. Why would someone engineer such a mechanism to just play a simple melody?

   No idea. Though it might have done something more than just playing a melody, something less obvious.

   Did you notice anything change here, maybe?

   Nope. Not yet, at least. I've been here in the house just as you were, though I did get up a bit earlier. Finally slept on a bed, too, haven't had
   that priveledge in a while.

   No bed here in the room I'm in. It's quite empty actually, just me and a table with the computer. Well, there's this new hallway, but it's empty
   too, besides the buttons near the end of it. There really isn't anything of interest here besides the computer, which is also the only source of
   light here, otherwise it's dark as hell. Well, maybe also me, but that's only if someone is looking for company. And I don't think
   there's anyone else here.

   Scary. You sure there's noone else there?

   I dunno.. There's simply no place to hide in the two empty rooms. Maybe I'm missing the full picture, maybe this is all just a big joke, and you're
   in on it too.

   I'm not. Or at least I'm not aware of it.

   Hope I can trust ya.

   Hope I can trust myself.

   Fair. Now, about this room.. The screen of this computer is taking care of darkness around, but it's not that bright, hope I can find something to
   brighten this place up in the future.

   Yeah, even if you're actually alone and not afraid, sitting in the darkness doesn't do you any good.

   Yep.. Now, what is this you're having for breakfast?

   <She seems to have something that looks like cereal with milk in the bowl.>

   The liquid in the bowl is a product of soaking and grinding a plant that grows in another region, far from here. It was discovered in an expedition
   to a place outside the known land of that time. When they were there, they found a different biome, a colder one. The reports said that it was a
   chilly out there and that the plants and trees there were different. They took some samples back, then the local people discovered various
   applications for them. One of which was to use them as food, because of their taste. You see, we don't really need food to survive. We don't feel
   hunger. But we do feel the taste, and that is what food is used here for. Want to taste it?

   <She passes you the carton.>

   Yeah, I'm feeling curious.

   <You take a sip. It tastes like milk with a slight bit of grass.>

   <p>: This taste reminds me of a certain drink I know about for some reason. This seems to be a reoccuring pattern, too.. I know about something,
   but can't remember where I got that knowledge.

   Usual for this place, if you ask me.

   Well, that logic might apply to you, but I'm here and you're there, it's a bit different.

   Indeed. You'll have to figure it out in some other way.

   So.. What about the other part of your meal?

   Oh, it's the leaves of a bush growing around, people have been using it as food for a long time. When dried, it changes its taste, and some people
   like it more in that state. I do, for example. Do you wish to taste this too?

   Since we're on it, yeah i'll take a bite.

   <You take a few from the box and taste them. It's really just dried leaves>

   Uh I dunno about this one. Really, it tastes like leaves.

   That's because they are leaves?

   Yeah. I just thought it'd be something more surprising.

   Sorry to disappoint! I like it, though. Now, let me finish my breakfast and we'll go take a stroll outside.

   Sure, take you time.

   <You spend a few minutes in the kitchen while she finishes her breakfast.>

   <narra>: Well, I'm done.. Let's go.

   <You go outside. She turns the lights off as she closes the door. She then look somewhere behind you with a confused look.>

   <narra>: Ah. This wasn't here yesterday. Might be the result of you solving that "puzzle" you talked about.

   <You turn around and see that in the distance, there are now tall buildings.>

   <p> So this is the city?

   Yep, that's the one.

   So, we'll go check it out, right?

   Sure, if you don't mind the long walk.

   It's not like we're short on time.. If I were to describe how much time we have, I'd say we've got all of it. Besides, not like there's anything
   else to do. Boredom really is a big problem around here.

   Oh yes, it very much is. So, there was a stone road that leads from here to the city. It was layed a bit after the city was started, to make
   the path through the woods easier. It starts out there, on the other side of the village.

   <After a short walk, you are on the stone road.>

   <narra>: Here it is. 

   Let's go, then. And if you don't mind, may I ask a few more questions?
** The long walk questions
   Sure. What do you want to talk about?

   Ask about..
*** IF (want to talk about the computers) THEN So.. You have computers here? How do they actually work?
    Yes, we do! I actually have one, too. You might've seen it in my living room. I got it recenly before everything disappeared, though now it feels
    like it's been forever. I used to have a bigger one, until it eventually broke down, probably from being so ancient, just refused to boot.. So I
    got a new one. Couldn't get the same one, they didn't make them like that anymore, I really got used to it, you know. So I got a new one. It was
    faster, but really, I didn't care much. I'm not very good with computers anyway, and I don't do anything complicated. Checking mail and blogging
    was good enough for me. We had a network that connected all computers together, making remote communication really easy.

    You have a blog? What is it about?

    Oh all the things, daily happenings, just sharing your status with friends, you know? So you don't loose touch. I was happy when I was told about
    it, there were people I knew that moved to the city on there. So i started using it a lot. Of course, now that everyone's gone, there is probably
    nobody on there..  We could still check it later when we get back. Or maybe we could find some kind of public computer in the city.

    Yeah, maybe.
*** IF (want to talk about plant based food) THEN It seems like all the food is made out of various plants. Do all people here only eat that?
    Yes? Well, we wouldn't eat each other, would we?

    Fair.. Here we have other foods, which are made of various creatures that are deemed not self-aware enough. People would raise them specifically
    to cook them later. I can't remember why, but I know that it exists and how it happens..

    That sounds pretty awful.

    It does, kind of. But these creatures live their best lives before they are made into food. They're well fed and cleaned. I can't say I'm too much
    against that, especially if they really don't even recognize themselves, just follow the instincts.

    While I can understand that, we never really sank that low as to abuse the less aware creatures.

    Yeah, I guess some of the reasoning for that would be that people in your world don't actually need to eat to survive. Eating other creatures
    gives way more nutrients. Maybe that was the main reason people eat them: to survive the tougher times. I'm sure there are people out there that
    are against that.

    In that case, it does make sense that people would use any means necessary to survive of course. Still, I'm glad that for us this problem never
    existed and we could circumvent it entirely and don't have a dire need to abuse creatures to survive and it makes me feel unwell that this had to
    happen in your case.

    Again, surely there must be other people that feel like you out there. Although I bet the opposite is also true, there might be people that enjoy
    it.

    What an awful world that must be. Still, surely, not all hope is lost if someone understand that it's bad.

    I suppose that's just how it is. The world is cruel like that sometimes.
*** If people here don't age, does that mean their appearance doesn't change since when they first find themselves here?
    Pretty much. Since I woke up here my appearance didn't change at all. The hair and the nails grow, but that's practically it. So Ib still have to
    look after them, but except that.. not much changes. You can get new clothes to change your looks a bit, certainly, but other than that the looks
    don't change too much. Some people actually wondered if anything could be done about that, but the research was started just recently and didn't
    go that far.

    I see.. Were all people here uh.. grown-ups?
    
    Not all of them, no. The "age" ranged considerably, there were all kinds of people. You couldn't really judge anyone by their appearance, because
    someone could look like a child, but have lived a long life already. Perhaps, we could talk to the people who did research on the topic, provided
    we'd find someone like that. Maybe in the city, since most of them lived there, it was the place for researchers to gather.
*** What's the city like in general?
    Uhm.. It's big! And it had a lot of people doing many things. A lot bigger than the village, you know. The buildings there were also actually
    built in regions designated for them, unlike in our village, where things were just made up as the time progressed and then were connected with a
    road. For the city, they actually planned areas for houses and for service and entertainment buildings, which where then built there gradually as
    the amount of people and ideas of what to build raised. In the housing areas, the houses were made with multiple floors and flats, to allow more
    people to live in those houses; and in the center of the city there is a lot less of housing and a lot more of the fun stuff like clubs, cafes,
    restaurants. Plus, since the city is so big there are also means of easier transportation between the parts of the city. Although they wouldn't
    help us since they require someone to operate them and I sure as hell have no idea how to do it. We can probably see some of them standing
    motionless though.

    Interesting.. What about nighttime, how's it at night?

    It'd be all lit up if there were people, night life there is a normal thing there, unlike in the village where we mostly go to bed and get up
    early; in the city, many people are more active at night, just because of the way they made their schedule; there are entertainment places where
    they go to meet their friends and make new ones, have a drink, dance. I tried that lifestyle for some time when I was in the city but I really
    just couldn't handle it, I think it takes a lot of time to get used to it; getting up so late just feels wrong.. and staying up after midnight is
    just too tiring for me..
*** Since the city is so big, they probably have some interesting different cuisine, right?
    Precicely. The food there is made of things gathered there from different places. Since they don't have much of their own food production, they
    have to get it from all the places around the world, while the rest of the world gets the "techonolgy" pieces from them, like computers and
    phones. As a consequence, you can also get food from other parts of the world there for yourself if you go to the city. The milk I had for
    breakfast, for example, I got from my last trip to the city.

    Wait.. Just to be clear, do you call that liquid you had "milk"?

    Yeah. That's what it's called.

    Huh.. I wonder about the origins of that name.

    No idea, really. I just used the name the people gave it, I weren't the one who made it up or anything.

    I see.. I guess it's the only kind of milk you've ever seen so there's no need to add anything to it's name.

    It's not really the ONLY one. There are kinds made from other things. It's just that since this one was discovered first, it got the name, and
    only after that did people tried experimenting with other things. Not all of those experiments were that successful..

    # Set want to talk about plant based food AND want to talk about the computers UNLESS already talked about them
*** Are we gonna stay in the city this night? Do you know anywhere to stay in case we have to?
    I hope we won't have to.. We got up pretty early and the day is still young, so there's a good chance we won't. Still, if we have to, we'll
    probably be able to stay at some kind of hotel, especially if there's nobody else there besides us. There are a few of those in the city, so
    finding one wouldn't be a problem. They were made especially for people like us, who come to the city for a short time and don't have any other
    place to stay at.

    Convinient..
** The city
   <Finally, after the long walk, you arrive. Judging by the position of the sun, it's somewhere around noon. The stone road you've been walking
   gradually changes to asphalt.>

   <narra>: We're here, finally! That was hell of a walk. I guess we could just keep going on the road and not the sidewalk, since, presumably,
   there's no transport on the roads right now.. We're in the suburbs currenly, so the buildings here are mostly houses.

   Yeah.. These look smaller compared to those in the distance. Are we heading deeper into the city?

   I'd say we should check a few houses first, to see if anyone's there. The chance is small but that's the main point why we're here.

   OK. So, are we gonna split and just go check a few houses here and there?

   I'd really rather not. I'm afraid that something might go wrong, like you'd get lost, and I'll be left alone again.

   I see. We'll check some houses together then.

   <Both of you go off the road, to the first house on the right, going up a stairway to the first floor>

   <narra>: Let's check the doors on this floor..

   <She comes to the first door and carefully turns the knob. The door is not locked. She looks at you somewhat worryingly.>

   <narra>: So.. should we go in?

   That's what we're here for, right?

   Yeah.. right..
*** Flat on the first floor
    <Narra goes through the door and you go after. You're now in the first flat on the first floor. It's not very big: there's what seems to
    be a bathroom, and the living room and the kitchen are made into a single room, with a kitchen counter inbetween. The living room part has a sofa
    and a small coffee table. There's a laptop on the table.>
**** Check the laptop
     <player> Should we.. check the laptop?

     I'm.. not sure. It's somebode else's, that'd be kinda rude..

     Well it's not like we're gonna go snooping around too much in there. Let's just see if there's anything that can help us "on the surface",
     alright?

     Okay.. I guess that's fine..

     <You come up to the laptop and press a random key. The laptop wakes up. The screen is locked, but there's no password, you just click the log in
     button and it does so. The only window on the is the blogging sofware. The top post says "Just got some new noodles, haven't seen those around
     here before, gonna check em out soon", underneath the text it says "posted undefined ago".>

     <p>: Is that the blogging thing you told me about?

     Yes, that seems like it. The date of the post makes no sense though. And, looking at it, other posts' dates are like that too.

     It wasn't able to determine the date, obviously, but what that actually means I do not know. Probably not much else to see here, since this is
     the only window on the computer, it was probably only used for writing on the blog.
**** Check the kitchen part of the room
     <You walk up to the fridge and open it. There's a bunch of different foods in there, some in bags, most unopened at all.>

     <narra>: So many interesting kinds of meals could be made from this.. Maybe we could get some from the city center too, when we're there.
**** Check the bathroom
     <You open the bathroom door and turn on the light. It blinks a few times at first, and then stays on as it should. The bathroom is mostly the
     same as Narra's, maybe even a little smaller.>

     <p>: Not much to see here.. Good thing we checked, anyway.
*** Leaving the first flat & go into the city
    <p>: Not much else to look at here. Should we go check out the other flats?

    Yea. Nothing more catches the eye here.

    <You leave the flat. Narra closes the door, leaving it as it was when you arrived.>

    <narra>: Let's check the other flats.

    <You nod. She goes to the opposite side of the corridor and turns the knob. The door is locked.>

    <narra>: Interesting.. So, the person who lived in that flat just forgot to lock their door? And their computer didn't have any password,
    too..

    Means they had nothing to hide, right?

    Maybe. Or they were careless.

    <You check the other floors, all the doors are locked. Same happens in the adjacent house.>

    <narra>: Seems like we just got lucky with that one.. All the others are probably locked, too. Let's head into the city and see what's up
    there.

    Agreed. This door checking getting boring anyway. You come up to the door and you just know it's locked, but you still try, with no luck. That
    first one was a big surprise.

    <You head into the city, going along the road, past all the same-looking houses. After some time, you reach the center part of the city, where all
    the night and day life happened.>

    <narra>: Never seen these streets so empty, it was bright and full of people even at night. Not anymore. Didn't think they'd ever end up like
    this. Hope they'll be the way they were before someday, even though I didn't like it at the time, it's sad to see them so devoid of life.

    <She stops for a few seconds, looking at the building to the right.>

    <narra>: Let's go see this one. This club was a hugely popular place to hang out at night, I got invited to go there at night a few times, but
    after the first one I didn't want to go there any more at all, too crowded.

    Shouldn't it be closed during the day?

    They didn't close it for the day, it's just that there weren't a lot of people there. That was the sweet time for me to go enjoy a few drinks.
*** Club
    <You go throuth the glass doors of the parade entrance, then through the long hallway, and to the actual dancefloor and the bar.
    As expected, there's nobody there.>
**** The bar
     <You come over to the bar. There are a few drinks on the bar.>

     <p> Well, if nobody else is here, we might as well have them, right?

     Uh.. sure. The drinks here were nice. I missed them.

     <You sit on the stool and take one the glasses, then have a sip. It's very, very sweet and has a slight strawberry flavor.>

     <p>: Yuck.. it's so sweet!

     Yes! This one's called "strawberry boom", because it's so sweet. But the aftertaste is nice.

     Actually.. maybe is is.. huh.

     The one I have here is a mix of milk and various syrops. It's not exactly a thing you'd get at the club, more like a cocktail. Wanna try it?

     Alright..

     <You take a sip of the cocktail. It is, indeed, a mixture of milk and various sweet syrops, although the which exact ones you can't quite figure
     out.>

     Uh.. don't know if I like it.

     Well. To each their own. Let's finish those and continue our investigation.

     Yeah. Investigation.
**** The dance floor
     <The tiles of the dance floor don't change colors. It seems like the program that controls them doesn't run during the day.  There are a few
     tables around it, one of which has a small white pack of someting, with "6" written on it.>

     <p>: Any idea what this pack is?

     Oh that one.. It's probably the popular bubble-gum. Yeah it's called "6". Because there are 6 of them in the pack.

     <You come up to the table and peek into the pack. There are 5 strips of gum in there.

     <p>: Five. They left an almost full pack here. What a waste.

     Maybe someone didn't like 'em. They don't exactly taste like.. anything. Just dull.

     Not too fancy of a gum, eh?

     Yep. It's very basic. If you want to just chew on something, maybe, or have no time to brush your teeth at all, although.. I'm not sure it helps
     with that?
*** Mall and the way back
    <narra>: That was a whole bunch of nothing, huh? I'm getting really desperate for something to change already! Come on..  Did we go all the
    way for nothing?

    Yeah.. Jeez. So boring! Maybe we should head back already?

    Come on, let's check a few more places, OK? And on our way, let's try to find a few bicycles to go back on, that should ease our way a bit.

    Oh, sure.. If you know where to get them.

    Yeah. We'll head for the big mall for now, there's a bike place there, I hope nobody is going to mind if we take them.

    There's probably nobody to do so..

    Yes. That's what I'm talking about.

    <You walk for bit more deeper into the city, until you see the big mall building. You know it's a mall because it has "City Mall" written on
    it. Who could've thought.>

    <narra>: I'll try to remember where exactly the bike place is, while you look around and see if there's anything interesting while we're on the
    way. This place is pretty big.

    <While you go, you notice a few clothing places, cosmetics stuff, lingerie, a huge food section, general applience stuff, and then, finally,
    you're at the bike place.>

    Well, just take the first one that fits you and let's go already.

    <She tries out a few bikes, stopping on a sporty looking green one. You grab the first one you see, the seat feels alright and the
    pedals are at the comfortable height, so you don't hesitate too much. Your bike is red, the best color. You set out on your way back
    immediately. The sun seems to already be setting. Just how much have you been walking here?>

    <narra>: What a disappointment. Not like it really matters, since the time is not a constraint, but still, it's disappointing. Now we know
    there's probably nothing there, at least.

    I guess that's true.. That wasn't very exciting, except when we actually did find something, you know?

    Not a lot of that, but yes..
** Back in the village
   <On the way back, you spend most of the time focusing on the road. The bikes make the journey quite a bit shorter. When you arrive, the sun has
   almost set and it's pretty dark. On your way to Narra's house you suddenly notice that the house on opposite side of the street has its lights
   turned on. You look at her. She looks at you.>

   <narra>: What the hell?! Is he.. actually in there?

   Is this your friend's house?

   Yes! Oh wow, can it be that he's there? That we aren't alone here? We have to check RIGHT NOW.

   <You both abandon the bikes in the middle of the road and run up to the house. She knocks on the door a few times and carefully opens
   it.>

   <narra>: Hey?

   <Behind the door, you see a guy, not too tall, shoulder length hair, wearing glasses. He jumps back, producing a high-pitched yell>

   <maj>: aaHHH!!

   <You see Narra giggle a little.>

   <narra>: Maj! Long time no see!!

   <maj>: Ah.. ha.. hi! I'm really lost.. since everything went down I can't remember much.. The panic, then darkness, and then I wake up in the
   forest this morning. I couldn't wrap my head around what happened, so I thought I'd just head back home, what else could I do? So I there I was,
   alone.. Which was scary.. so I just spent the whole day at home..

   <narra>: Oh wow.. That's a bit different.. but.. uh.. let's come in and not just stand here, eh?

   <maj>: Ohh.. yeah! Sure.. and who's the person behind you might be..? if you don't mind me asking..

   <narra>: Ah, that's <p>. They're.. uh.. new here. Apparently they're from the "outside", like the "creator" was.

   <maj>: Wow! Never thought I'd meet someone like that ever again..

   <p>: Hello! While it's true i'm from the "outside", I don't know anything about that "creator" person, nor do I know anything about myself.. or
   anything outside the room I'm in, really..

   <maj>: Oh.. shame.. but still, welcome! Let's head into the kitchen and have some tea at least, like Narra suggested, we shouldn't
   just stand in the doors.

   <You all head to a room on the left, it's a medium-sized kitchen. You and Narra sit at the table, while Maj puts some water into the electric
   kettle, the water boils rather fast, and after a minute you all sit at the table with some tea, which is still too hot to drink, but already smells
   minty.>

   <maj>: So, how have you been?

   <narra>: You said that you only remember darkness and then you woke up back in the forest, but it was very different for me. It has actually
   been a very long wait for me. All that was left of the world was a single room with gray walls, and nothing else, and that's where I was all that
   time. I'm a bit envious of you not having to experience that. I never want to stay alone with nothing and nobody else but myself. I'm glad you're
   back too now, it's been about a day since the world has returned back to normal.. well.. except all the people. <p> helped me get out of that room
   by doing somethig on the outside. Something also changed this night, while I was asleep.

   <p>: Yeah.. There was some kind of a corridor, with a stupid puzzle. So I pressed a few buttons, a melody played, and that somehow brought back the
   city. And you, too, it seems. Looking forward to more changes like that in the future.

   <maj>: Wow.. that is a lot to process.. First off, it's very sad Narra had to experience this. But that's behind you now, and everything's gonna be
   fine, right?

   <narra>: I.. sure hope so. There are still so many people missing.. But we'll try to get them back! We've been to the city with <p> today, it's
   as empty as everything else, so we really just wasted a lot of time.

   <maj>: Such a big city and nobody there too.. So we're the only people here..

   <narra>: We haven't found anyone else.. But seeing you now makes me excited! More people might be coming back soon..

   <maj>: Oh I can't wait for that..! I already miss all the life around here..

   <narra>: We'll be progressing with that soon, I hope. In the meantime, <p>, Maj was one of the people who designed the first computers around
   here! So you can ask something about them..

   <p>: Oh!

   <maj>: Well.. I only participated in the initial design and development of the first models, they were quite clumsy and big.. Nowadays computers
   are a lot smaller, all of that happened after they moved to the city, and I mostly resigned from duty and stayed here. We made the network, mail
   and blogging platforms to communicate with each other, I'm sure Narra told you about that. So, I still got the news about new inventions and
   research and even got to participate in a few, but it mostly still still required being there in person, so it happened rarely.

   <p> Why didn't you want to go to the city with them and continue working on the cool stuff?

   <maj>: You see.. I really don't like big crowds of people and the city is ALL about that.. I get all anxious.. So I'd rather stay.. besides, the
   scientific community has grown a lot since the beginning and I'm sure they can go on without me.

   <narra>: Don't you belittle your part in that, you dummy! They wouldn't be able to make it like it is without your work, and you know it. You
   didn't really leave them for good with no news or anything, you still kept up with people from there, didn't you?

   <maj>: Yes.. ok, ok, you got me. I don't really like to admit it, because it'd sound like I'm bragging. But enough about that, there's another
   interesting thing: we designed the computers with long range networking in mind, and put some big servers in places where they'd be needed and
   where we could connect computers to them and then connect the servers together. One of them is actually right here, in the basement of my house, I
   rarely go down there so it might be a bit dusty, but we can go see it.. if you're interested.

   <p>: Sure, I wanna see it.

   <Since you all are already done with the tea, you all stand up, and wait for Maj to lead the way. However, he just moves his chair and you notice
   that there's a trapdoor underneath. He lifts it, then reaches inside to find the light switch and turns it on. He then steps on the ledder there
   and starts going down. You look as he goes down, it's not that deep down there, just a few meters. He waves at you, telling you can go down
   now. You climb down the ladder first, then Narra climbs after you.>

   <p>: You know.. this really looks like the room I am in. I mean, on the "outside". Except yours is way better lit.

   <maj>: Do you really spend all your time in an almost empty concrete box?

   <p>: It's not like I have a choice..

   <maj>: Anyway. Here it is, this big boy handles all the communication between the village and the city.

   <You look at the server. It's a rack filled with all kinds of boxes and wires, all blinking with different colors.>

   <maj>: In the city, there are a few of servers like this once, since it's a lot bigger. The city is like a hub for communication.

   <p>: I think I'm noticing a pattern here.

   <maj>: It only makes sense that the city would be the center of all things, doesn't it? So.. I wasn't sure about how to use the basement for a
   while, but this thingy here fit in quite well, and it doesn't take space in the house, plus it gets all the underground coolness.

   <p>: So it's not just me, it really is colder in here?

   <narra>: I've noticed, too.

   <maj>: Yes! Besides being underground, this place is also additionally cooled down artificially. Otherwise it'd get pretty hot in here, this thing
   produces a lot of heat. There's not much to see other than the server, but I am proud of it and will take any opportunity to show this setup to
   someone if they ask, albeit it might sound like braggning, it did take some planning to set up. Now, let's get out of here, I'm feeling cold
   myself.

   <You all get out of the basement in the reverse order. Maj closes the trapdoor and moves his chair back.>

   <maj>: Now, it's getting really late, I'd love to talk some more, but maybe we should continue tomorrow?

   <narra>: I'm actually suddenly very tired, probably because the trip, I just realized it. Didn't notice at first because I was so excited to see
   you! We'll probably head back to my place then, <p> is staying at my house for now, until we maybe figure out else.

   <maj>: See you tomorrow, then!

   <p>: I wonder what'll happen tomorrow.. and how today's night will go. On my side, the the computer screen just goes black for a while.

   <maj>: We'll know sooner if we go to sleep sonner, haha.

   <p>: Yeah, good night!

   <maj>: You too!

   <You and Narra leave the house and get back to her place, she takes a shower, and you both head to bed.>

   <narra>: I'm exhausted.. Goodnight, I guess, even though it doesn't mean much for you apparently.

   <p>: Still, I appriciate it. Let's see what tomorrow brings.

   <She falls asleep fast, you soon follow.>
* Day 3
** Night after day 3 :walking:
   The second part of the puzzle room is now open (and all the buttons are green, since the puzzle has already been solved). There's a table on the
   other side of the room, with a note which should open as a full screen thing allowing to read it properly. The text on it is:


   That last iteration wasn't a good idea at all. Really, most things I came up with don't work that well, this time they turned violent against other
   creatures. Eventually, when they eradicated those, they started killing each other.. Except her, of course. Should've seen that coming. This
   one's going into the trash too.

   passwd: aqualung

   Small text on the bottom of the page: "ctrl z switch instance"
   
   There's also a working lamp on the table, which the player should be able to take and put back in the computer room.

   After that, when the player gets back to the computer, the screen will still be black and the text on the bottom should say
   something like Ctrl+Z to switch instance.
