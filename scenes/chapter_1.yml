    After finishing your programming exam fourty-nine minutes in advance, it is time to leave. You pack your bag, drop your sheet on the teacher's desk, and leave the room.

    There's nobody around, since people are doing their exams, so it's really quiet in the building.
    You get to the first floor and go not to the main entrance, but to the one on the side of the building, that way you can cut a little,
    as you'd need to go around there anyway.
  answers:
    "Go outside": {}

    After about ten minutes of walking, you arrive at the metro station.
    You scan your card, walk around a cleaning employee and other travelers, unaware of the situation you and hundreds of other people will soon be a part of.
  answers:
    "Get on the escalator": {}

    On the platform, you lean on the far right glass door, which separates the station and the railway. That door is the closest one
    to the exit on your destination station, so you choose to get to it, since you'll be waiting for the train for some time anyway.


    The platform fills up with passengers, and you are the first one to enter the train.


    Right as the doors open, you manage to take a seat, this allows you to rest for a bit, since the rest of the trip is going to be somewhat long.
  answers:
    "Rest": {}

    The ride goes along as usual, the time between stations always something around a minute and the doors are staying opened for around fiteen seconds at each station,
    although two stations before your destination the train has to stay on the station for a longer time, because of people who've never heard of neither the rush hour,
    nor the the existence of a maximum passenger capacity of vehicles.

    Your ride finally comes in at the station. You get off and go towards the escalators. Everyone is going straight forward and taking the same escalator.
  answers:
    "Take the escalator with everyone else": { SCENE: start6-crowded }
    "Obviously, take another, almost completely empty, escalator": { SCENE: start6-empty }

start6-crowded:
  text: >
    You get on the escalator with other people and while riding it you wish there were seats there just like in vehicle you just got out of,
    as the escalator is quiet long and is filled with people. Some of them even try to climb up faster, but they don't succeed at that much, since everyone
    is already uncofortable with their position and can't do anything but wait until they're finally at the top and can continue their journey to wherever the fuck
    they so desperately try to get while ignoring everyone else.
  answers:
    "Finally, you're at the top": { SCENE: start7 }

start6-empty:
  text: >
    You get on the empty escalator with some people following your example, now probably thinking about why'd they even want to go on the other one, if it's
    so tightly packed. As you run up the escalator to cut some time, yoy see someone on the other escalator trying to climb through the people and failing miserably, leaving them
    in an even more uncomfortable pose, between the stairs, than the other people there.

    "You reach the top": { SCENE: start7 }

    After a little more walking, you notice, with some regret, that the train you're going to use hasn't been assigned a track yet.
    From your experience, though, you know it will probably depart from track three.

    16:52


    Only ten minutes left before your train's planned departure time. Masses of regulars are already forming in front of the train's six cars, only waiting for the authorization to open the doors.


    The newbies are forming a crowd in the main hall, first into a properly spaced crowd letting others walk through, then into a more and more compact crowd.
  answers:
    "Wait": {}

    Here they are. The voice recordings, played one after the other, announce to the public that the regional train departing at five hours and two minutes
    will depart from track three. From there starts the usual flow of people on the platform, walking fast, almost running, with the only goal to find a seat on one of the carriages.


    "Nothing unusual could be expected out of this", you say to yourself.

start10:
  text: >
    Yet somehow said unusual materialized itself in how strong some of those passengers' will to find a seat is, how much they want to travel comfortably while laughing at the less courageous people,
    standing between rows of seats, or staying outside the train, in the event of it being so overcrowded people wouldn't be able to get in anymore.

    A few months ago, when a train went head-first into someone, all trafic got paralyzed for two to three hours.
    But just a few minutes after that collision happened, it has been offered to waiting passengers to get to another train station a few hundred meters away,
    to take a high-speed train and transfer to another station to arrive at their destination.


    That was the only time that you saw people actually running for their seats at the station. Not just the ones who were late, but the whole crowd of passengers.

start12:
  text: >
    This is the second time.


    Travelers from the main hall are running on the platform, forcing regulars to also run to not get overtaken.
    Some wheeled suitcases, the worst inventions of humanity on par with strollers, collide with each other during this ever-hastening run.


    Behind a group of people trying to get on, you see the train’s middle carriages approaching, these are the best option to get off quickly at your destination and
    have a chance to not get stuck in the crowd, waiting for everyone to make up their mind on where they need to go now.


    As you are about to leave the opposite side of the platform, where you've been staying up until now, since going along that side is easier, to cross the platform and get to your train,
    you see someone stumbling on a suitcase and falling on the rails.
  answers:
    "Help them get up, at the risk of losing your seat": { SCENE: start12-help }
    "Move along": { SCENE: start12-dont-help }

start12-help:
  text: >
    You start fighting through the crowd to the edge of the platform to help that person. As you are about to open your mouth and yell that they should give their hand,
    the train arrives. Hemoglobine-filled body fluids splatter on the platform and everyone near it, including you. Nobody had seen
    it come, and the driver did not have the time to stop.


    Also, you better hurry for your train now.

    While a hint of humanity sparkles in your brain, it momentarely gets shattered to pieces by people trying to push you to the
    side, since you slowed down a bit after that fall. This little shine isn’t alone in getting smashed to pieces;
    hemoglobine-filled body fluids splatter on the platform, after a train arrived on the rails. Nobody had seen it come, and the driver did not have the time to stop.

    "Keep pushing through the crowd to your train": { SCENE: start13 }

    In normal circumstances, this event would have stopped everyone, horrified by the spectacle that happened right before
    their eyes due to their individualism, their only will of sitting on a piece of fabric for half an hour,
    and their very mediocre sense of prorities. But before anyone had time to imagine themselves being a doctor in philosophy or sociology, panic comes in.

start14:
  text: >
    Not to get away from this dead body, but to get on the train even faster. Some start making roars, like animals ready to attack,
    and everyone starts charging, running faster and faster. Luggages starts flying above the crowd, some trying to get rid of their belongings just to go faster.

start15:
  text: >
    You notice two women besides you trying to tear off each other’s hair for some reason, in a position reminding you of a rugby melee,
    and you hear a scream of pain to your right coming from a kid, laying on the ground, their body covered in blood, mutilated by kicks of this enraged horde.
  answers:
    "Help the kid": { SCENE: start15-help }
    "Move along": { SCENE: start15-dont-help }

    You turn to the right, where the kid is, bear though the all the mad people running for their seats.
    Someone pushes you and you fall over, ready to get up immediatly, but some crazed man stomps your hand with his heeled boot.


    It hurts a lot, but you manage to get up.


    The crowd pushes you farther and farther from the child, you can't even see them anymore,
    you have no choice but to continue running with the crowd.

start16:

    You proceed to join the horde, trying as best as you can to protect yourself using your coat, picking up
    a cane some elderly must have dropped and using it to keep those hungry zombies away from you. Step
    by step, you slowly get closer to your target.

    At the train door you try to reach, a few people are blocking your way, doing their best to fend off those
    inhuman seat-hungry creatures. You see a familiar face: it's your friends, with whom you share your train rides from time to time when your schedules meet, he is on board and recognizes you.


    You see him warning others of your presence and they wave at you to tell you to get closer.

start18:
  text: >
    Only two meters left. You punch some hefty man’s private parts with your cane before he manages to crush
    your skull with his decapitated woman’s, and you somehow manage to get a grip of your friend's hand. He pulls
    on your arm to help you reach the doorstep. An old woman, very old, tries to cling to your bag,
    but someone in the train throws an empty can at her, it hits hard enough to knock her out.
  answers:
    "Get in the train": {}

    Stumbling on the doorstep and saying hello to the floor, you finally get in the train.
    You quickly notice your saviours did a really good job: the train is almost empty.
    They must have gotten in way before others.


    You gather the strength you have left, get up, grab some projectiles scattered on the floor and help your new colleagues to defend your positions.

    17:01


    There has not been any announcement made inside the train by the controller, for obvious reasons.
    Reasons that are starting to fight in retreat, noticing the imminent failure of their attack and having trouble walking with all the corpses littering the station.

start21:

    As you start to run out of ammunition, the uniform alarm announcing the doors’ imminent closing is music to your ears.
    You use your last strengths to help the door slide more quickly and push all those weird arms covered in wounds trying to keep you from leaving out of the train.
    An arm stays stuck in the door, but the oldest of you gets an axe and chops it off.

start22:
  text: >
    The door finally closes, and you take a moment to catch your breath, still in the shock from all that happened.
    You thank your rescuers and you all go get your well deserved seats in a train, almost as empty as during off-peak hours, in the comfiest part of the train.

    17:04


    While your train leaves with its usual small delay, you hear knocks on the windows from the few survivors of the past butchery, followed by gunshots.


    You do not know where they come from.


    Well, you did not even know those sounds were gunshots before one of the doors’ window got shattered.

start24:
  text: >
    A very loud and acute scream is heard throughout the train, scaring you more that the window shattering sound itself, and all of you duck.


    Luckily enough, the train leaves the station just in time to avoid additionnal damage.


    You look into your bag, grab a big unused plastic bag and your friend offers his help. You manage to close the hole in the window and keep the heat inside the train.

    Back on your seats you have fought so much for, you all look at each other in silence.
    No verbal communication is required for all of you to know all of you are asking yourselves the same questions.

    As far as you are concerned, those questions may find their answer at some point, but for now, you are on your Christmas holidays and have a warm seat on the train.
