    It has now been nine minutes since the departure of the empty train you are currently on, during rush hour, sitting on one of the best seats,
    with a couple people, including one of your friends. Everyone stays silent during the trip, nobody knowing what to say or think of what happened to you.

    You turn on your phone’s screen and search for news articles about the recent events, but nothing comes up.
    As you go back to contemplating the landscape outside the window, and as the clock turns to 17:14, the train is engulfed by a very bright white light, dazzling you.

    After finishing your programming exam fourty-nine minutes in advance, it is time to leave.
    You abruptly stop the routine task of packing your bag and raise your head to look at the other students and the teacher.
    You all look at each other in confusion, and one student dares to ask the question:

    While everyone is asking questions, trying to come up with eccentric hypotheses or just panicking,
    you try to think as hard as you can that the fingers of your left hand are able to go through the palm of your right hand. You physically push your fingers against your palm,
    while imagining this impossible act, and nothing universe-breaking happens. The reality check proves that you are not in some sort of nightmare,
    but in a physical reality. So.. either all of you have been victims of a collective hallucination, or you have traveled back in time.

    You pack your bag, drop your answer sheet on the teacher’s desk, and leave the room while the teacher tries to calm everyone down.


    You go donwn the stairs once again, it's not that quiet anymore, you hear people from other rooms talking loudly, tryuing to figure out what happened and
    other teachers trying to calm everyone down.


    You exit the building and run to the metro statio, catching up with your two minute delay.

    While waiting for the announcement of the train’s departure from track three, you decide to post your thoughts on a local anonymous forum. While
    these tend to have many rambling, some people give their genuine thoughts there and your post will reach a big amount of people, who might
    at least give you an interesting read later on.

    You write something in the spirit of "Did the time just rewind? I was in the train and after the flash i was back at my exam classroom! What do you people think?"
    and attach a cute image to make the post stand out more.

    After some time, you check your post again and after the obligatory insults, you see some actuall answers on the topic.
    One of the users says they were at home for the day, so they didn't even notice anything except a flash, and then the time on their
    computer changed, which they ignored, because computers are sometimes dumb like that, but now that they see that other people are talking about it,
    it seems strange.


    The other user seems to agree with your point and says that their office had a shorter shift today and they were already at home, but after
    the flash they were back at their workplace, together with their coworkers, and one of them suddenly fell on the floor, when they checked on him,
    he had no pulse.


    Having read that, you actually notice that the stations is a lot less crowded. Maybe people freaked out and
    decided to stay at home, instead of taking their train. Either that, or the people who were murdered by other mindless zombies
    the last time you were here (several minutes in the future, according to your phone's clock), stayed dead even after the time went back,
    and that coworker was unlucky enough to get crushed by the..

    There's also a good chance that the people on the forum are just a bunch of trolls playing together, which seems to be the case a lot of the times on
    the internet.


    Finally, the announcement is made and the train arrives on the track three.

    You walk calmly and get on the train, you notice the same people you rode with the last time are there too,
    you all take your seats on the same spots as last time. Just to be sure, you check that the previously shattered door window no longer is.
    It seems that when the time rewinds, the physical state of the objects is restored, but living beings only have their bodies restored,
    not their "minds", or "souls", or whatever, you're not sure.

    Your theory is that you have gone fifty-one back to the past.

    Also, living beings, most importantly humans, stay dead even after the time rewinds, although their bodies looks fine.

    You are now pretty certain though, considering the people who died before the return to the past have actually died once again, that you have not been victims of a collective hallucination,
    neither did all of you have the same nightmares.

    The trip goes by without much trouble, and you continue your discussions on your theories and read Wikipedia articles on time traveling.

    You check your post on the forum again, but it seems that people have already lost interest in it, the only new response to your post reads
    "i was asleep the whole time, yes i have a fucked up sleep schedule, don't judge me, but i feel like i got more sleep then usual".

    At this moment, you tell yourself that this won't possibly happen again, that it will never be explained by scientists and that you will just move on. Things like
    that probably happen from time to time.


    You just hope that you'll be able to go home and eat some good raclette while waiting for your Christmas presents.


    But this hope has a hard time staying in your thoughts: Jehovah’s witnesses, standing next to the train station’s bus stops just like every morning and evening on weekdays,
    are this time not just waiting for someone to come by and grab one of their magazines. They are screaming at people, saying the end is nigh, inviting passersby to join their cause,
    to waste their money in this cult to be forgiven for their sins and to go to heaven, hoping someone will be gullible enough to believe them.

    You go around them and go back to your planned route, heading towards your sweet bed and lovely blanket.


    During the whole walk, you can't throw what happened before out of your head, feeling a little paranoid, you cannot stop looking behind you, all around you,
    to make sure not to have any blind spots, just to be ready to flee from any kind of danger.

    Everything is going well until you see a crowd of people filling the whole width of the street, waiting for something outside, in the cold.
    You might be able to go through them if you really want to, but this might make some of them angry or annoyed.


    Due to some construction work on most bridges of the city, you cannot avoid walking in this street to head home.

    You go closer, to first figure out why's there so much people. Quickly, you notice a huge poster in front of the butchery,
    announcing there are huge discounds on duck, goose and turkey meat, and it's friday, too, the sale seems to go pretty well.
    A huge amount of people waiting to get their hands on some good meat for a low price for their christmas table.


    You try to push through the crowd, being as polite as possible, not to angry them. Almost halfway through, you hear a scream.
    Not a human scream though, but that of a pig. People in front seem concerned, and then suddenly turn around to run from the shop,
    some buping into the people behind them. Then, the shop's window shatters, and a huge pig comes ramming out of it, right into the crowd.

    You quickly turn around in search of something reminiscent of a shelter, when you see someone climbing on the ladder to a rooftop of a building the
    huge pig is heading to. The person is lucky to get up successfully, just before the pig smashes it's head against the ledder, which makes the ladder fall
    down, on the head of an unlucky mother, which seemed to want to go for that same ladder.

    Since the crowd is now gone, you run in the direction of your home, trying to get as far away from this butchery as possible, when you hear more screams,
    and when you turn your head back, you see a bunch of smaller pigs running out of the butchery (for a moment, you wonder how did all of them even got there
    in the first place, and why's there so much livestock in such a place).

    You suddenly turn to the side and run into the alleyway, which turns out to have a wall with trash container put right besides it.
    You get up the container, as the pigs seem to catch up with you, but are too stupid to get up on the container to go after you,
    so they just pile up one on another, screaming, and when the pile is hight enough for them to get up on the container, you've already
    climbed on the wall.


    You look on your phone's clock. 18:04. If the flashes rewiding time were not a one-time thing, which is what you have assumed until now,
    the next flash should come right about now, and if that really was a one-time phenomenon, you'll have to come up with something else.

    The clock turns to 18:05 and you see a bright light sphere coming from afar, you're safe for now, but what bothers you is that there will
    probably be more flashes and more disasters, if there's already been two.

    You continue running and soon reach the bridge, under which you're able to hide from the pig horde.
    Under the bridge, you find the man that you saw on the rooftop, aparently when pigs oliterated everyone who lingered near the shop for a little longer,
    they went for the train station, giving him a chance to get down from the roof and hide under the bridge.

    Today's friday, this could not have been a better time for such a sale, and it seems to be working pretty well.
    Dozens of parents, sometimes accompanied with their children, waiting for their turn to fatten up at a low cost, are blocking your way.

    Those are not human screams, but pig. You laugh a bit, telling yourself those children may not be really human, before some people start to run.

    You see someone climbing up a ladder left on a construction site to get on a roof.

    The crowd quickly spreads out in front of the animal, who starts chasing and attacking everyone it sees.
    The man you try to join lends you his hand as the sow runs towards you. He pulls you on the roof right before the ladder gets hit and falls on the ground,
    right over a mother who was trying to get her daughter to come with us, bashing her on the head and probably killing her instantly.

    Dozens of other pigs are coming out of the butchery, and you do not even try to ask yourself why is there so much alive livestock in this shop or how there can be so much in such a small space.
    You witness everyone panicking on the street, parents and children agonizing in the middle of the road, including the now-orphan daughter of the woman hit by the ladder, their skin wounded by pig trotters.
    A grandmother, up until now miraculously spared, falls after getting hit by two of the enraged animals at once.
