    You think that you might as well listen to what he has to say, it wouldn't hurt you, and you might
    get some laughts out of it.


    He speaks loudly: "Everyone! By the wish of our Lord, Jesus Christ, i must tell you the words you have to hear. Fear not, and hear me out, as that is your path to salvation!"

    You too, stranger, must listen me out, for i have brought you the truth!

    "First off", he says, "thank you for listening.", and then, after a short pause, continues:
    "You have of course heard of the madness happening, making people kill their brothers and sisters, making them destroy what surrounds them".

    Indeed, you have seen what happened, and news spread fast. It seems this man has a theory on what's happening, "Maybe he isn't really all that bonkers", you think to yourself.
    You should consider all the theories out there if you want to dig out the truth.

    "Many people have no idea how this could've happened, but we know!", he continues, "And even though we, Witnesses of the true God, Jehovah,
    were called sectants, were despised by people, we're not holding a grudge on you. For we have brought news."
  answers:
    '"That might be true. Although judging by how you are talking about your god and stuff, you are gonna try to tell me about how the world is going to end soon, and that i better start beliving in your dogmas now, right?"': {}

    "I'm afraid not, my friend. The world is not near it's end", he tells you. That's surprising.
  answers:
    '"Huh? What is the matter then?"': {}

    "The Armageddon is already here", he says, making a dramatic pause, maybe thinking that you need some time to let what he just said sink in and make a bigger impression.
  answers:
    '"Well, alright. Now what?"' : {}

    "Our beliefs tell us, that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ has happened a long time ago already. More than a hundred years, really. Although, this was not the Armageddon, the destruction of the mortal world.
    After the Second Coming, Jesus has gathered an army of the righteous, and then he's been waiting, until the war begins."
  answers:
    '"And you think it has just started, right?"': {}

    "Sadly, that's how it is. One can call this the first battle.", he answers, and then, grabbing some more air into his lungs, continues, "As we all know, the enemy of Jesus is, of course,
    Satan, the destroyer of humanity, and his army is neither angels, nor the spirits of the righteous, but demons. Posession by demons explains any bursts of destruction and violence done by living beings, and
    I'm not talking about just humans, there have been evidence of animals getting possessed too. The souls loose control of their bodies, and demons are happy to give hell and death to the impenitent, make them suffer."
  answers:
    '"..so?", you say, already getting impatient for the culmination of their theory': {}

    "There will only be more massacares happening. The last war, the good versus the evil. Sorry if you think that's too much, but that's how it is", he finishes his theory.

    Why did you even think he was NOT bonkers? You can probably safely disregard their theory, but you decide to stay for a little more and ask some questions, just to see him react to them.
  answers:
    '"And by the forces of the good participating in the war, you, of course, mean, that you, the Jehovah witnesses, will be participating in the battle too, right?"': {}

    "Not at all, we've always been avoiding any wars, and we're not going to participate in this one, too.", he says, and that comes as a surprise to you, but you keep listening, as he continues:
    "We admit, that many will die as a result of this battle, that includes us, but we, Jehovah's Witnesses, actuall avoid any violence at all. The true belivers do. The great and righteous people of our
    ranks are already in heaven, and they have becames the spirits of our God, they will battle in the war, and thouse of us, who will die in the last battles, will be revived after some times, when Jesus will rule the world."
  answers:
    '"So, the world will be populated by Jehovah's witnesses, then, while other people will go to hell?"': {}

    "Do I have to answer, honestly?", he asks, surprised. "Answer the way your beliefs, the ones you try to make people believe in, tell you to answer", you tell him.

    He, once again, takes a breather, and continues: "No. Now, I know, there are many delusions about our religion. Yes, our teachings are the most correct in explaning
    what the humanity should expect, but practicers of other religions can join the holy spirits, too. Some of my collegues, if I may say so, say that that includes even non-christians, although
    I do not believe that myself, considering that the might of Jesus, and not anybody else, shall lead the world soon, not some Magomed or Buddah, not to mention pagan gods, that men have come up with and that have never existed.
    One just has to give up any violence, in any form, avoid sins, confess one's eveil deeds, and, of course, avoid them in the future."
  answers:
    '"So, why do you think that what is happening is the "Armageddon"? Many mass hysterias have happened before, as far as i remember. The diseases of dances, of laughter, of violence.."': {}

    "Alas, that we can just believe in", he says, somewhat disappointed, "but the proof shall come soon. You'll see."
  answers:
    '"Well, then, I refuse"': {}

ch2-jehovah-12:
  text: >
    "Refuse to what?", he asks, somewhat confused.
  answers:
    '"To believe. To do that, i will have to think everything out. And get proof of the fact that I really should do it."': {}

    "This is reasonable for many things, I cannot argue. But in spiritual matters like that, there's always a risk of dying, before you choose the right side", he says,
    finally loosing confidence in getting you involved, but still trying his best to convince you.
  answers:
    '"Then it is even more important to have proof, to know the rightness of your side"': {}

    Maybe, that is true, but even if the "hysteria" of people is just a temporary effect, and not the sign of the Armageddon being here, not just being close... Is confessing your sins evil?
    It will cleanse you, bring you closer to the truth". It seems that he has completely given up.
  answers:
    '"Oh well. It has been interesting to talk to you, but now, i should get going. Have fun", you tell him, turning around': {}

    "As you wish", he sighs, "Goodbye, I hope you will be back someday"
