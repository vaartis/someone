    Fifty-one minutes.


    This is the span between two flashes, and the duration we go back to.


    In slices of fifty-one minutes, people live the present a second time. That could look very useful, or even life-saving, allowing to fix mistakes;
    but what they are currently experiencing only allow them to fix physical mistakes, not on living beings. The dead do not get brang back to life, the wounded stay so, but most importantly, the memories do not go away.

    This does not only apply to humans; the enraged pigs of the first pass between fourteen past five and five past six post meridiem stayed that way during the second pass,
    according to online news articles stating they have been euthanized. The whole metabolism process seems to be affected; you slept for around eight hours and twenty minutes in only four hours and nineteen minutes,
    and wake up by yet another flash, around eighteen minutes past four ante meridiem, that sends you back to twenty-seven minutes past three.


    You have more than enough time to publish an article on your blog, like some people already did just to panic about all that is currently happening, but you put yours in the "Productivity" category:
    you write about a way to profit from, or at least adapt to, these time phenomena that make physicists jump of joy or anger.
    Since one of the two fifty-one minute long passes is without any material consequence, one should use it to take care of themself, to eat, sleep, have a social life,
    and use the other pass for more materialist tasks, like construction work, buying things, signing documents, etc.


    You also take the time to romanticize this whole story, in the form of a diary divided in chapters, where you talk in first person and use a non-omniscient point of view,
    hoping you could get any kind of profit from it when it all ends, if it ever ends. In the meantime, many other incidents happen.

    You notice the incedents were only caused by human or animal actions; buildings did not collapse, there were no natural disasters, only accidents, shootings, riots, etc.


    Your hypothesis is that someone or something is taking control of a group of individuals, for now always of the same species, to disrupt the daily routines and create a severe problem,
    observe people's reactions, then undo almost everything.


    Here your are now creating your own conspiracy theory. At some point, you may join the Jehovah's witnesses!


    All things considered, that probably would not be such a bad thing; with the current events, everyone is making up their own theories on the topic, and believing to such conspiracies is becoming mainstream.

ch3-4:
  text: >
    During what was left of the night, you do some deeper research on returns to the past, particularly on the theories some fans of the show wrote about the feasibility of
    a concrete implementation in the real world, while respecting the laws of physics as we know them. Aside from the impossibility of such a process or of almost everything related to the supercomputer,
    you could not find anything that would actually matter in the current situation.


    You then have a look at what inspired the show; maybe not everything was a fiction, or maybe the entities who made those temporal perturbations happen,
    if they exist, got inspired from those too.

    Saturday the twenty-fourth of December, twenty minutes past seven ante meridiem, Central European Time, post-flash time span.


    You go down the stairs, put on your coat, pick up your backpack and leave with your scooter, heading to the bus stops two hundred meters away from your home, to go the train station.


    If you have to witness another incident, you'd like it to happen while you're in a comfortable seat and without having to chop another arm off, if that is not too much to ask.

    You start a conversation with the driver.
    He explains that there usually are a few Saturday workers taking the bus at this hour, but today there is nobody on the bus,
    or even on the streets. Douai is often empty, particularly in the morning during weekends, but it got even worse than usual.


    Everyone is afraid, even more now that another incident happened in the city at around five and a half in the morning;
    an explosion in a building on your district, reminding you of another explosion that happened on a night of 2010 when someone tried to kill themself.
    They survived, but not their neighbors. Sad story.

    As you arrive at the train station, your phone rings a little to notify you that the already rewinded fifty-one minute interval has ended.
    It means that anything you do in the next fifty-one minutes will be of little importance, especially for your wallet.
    You proceed to enter a nearby restaurant, but you are stopped in your attempt at having a breakfast when you witness the bus driver’s probable death,
    due to the street light that went through the windshield after getting torn off the ground by a bus coming a little bit too fast from the other side.


    Strangely, your desire to get breakfast suddenly becomes a desire to not stay here.

    After a few minutes of riding your scooter, going as fast as your left leg would let you, you sit in the grass, far away from any trees.
    You feel the dew making your pants a little wet. You manage to calm down after some time and to fall asleep while the sun rises. You wake up with another flash,
    the seventeenth since the beginning of these events.

    Saturday, the twenty-fourth of December, forty-two past seven ante meridiem, Central European Time, post-flash span.


    You get off the bus without looking at the driver’s seat, expecting to see a corpse. Trying as hard as you can to think of something else,
    you hastily join the departures display under the passageway that allows regular travelers to enter the train station faster.
    Your high-speed train to Paris-Nord, departing at fifty-one past seven, awaits you on track 1.

    Making your parents believe that you were going for a very important job interview for my internship next year in Paris, and there were no seats left in second class, worked pretty well.

    Your findings make you believe there could be a supercomputer like the one in show implanted at the Seguin island.
    This island in the middle of the Seine used to host a car factory that shut down and got demolished and replaced by the Seine musicale, a big concert hall.
    It was the inspiration for the abandoned factory in the show, under where the supercomputer was hidden.
    By going there directly and observing some suspect behaviors, you are hoping to test that theory today.


    You explained this theory to Valou when he got in touch with you after he read your last blog article and was no longer able to sleep.
    You also asked a three-dimensional amateur modeler you know, Rémi, who modeled the real factory a few years ago, for some details on the factory and the differences between the show and reality.

ch3-12:

    Running out of other ideas, you all agree on meeting each other as soon as possible.
    You made your decision at around six o’clock, right after a new flash.
    Rémi would leave from the Bordeaux-Saint-Jean train station at four minutes past seven, Valou would depart from Lyon-Part-Dieu at the same time,
    and you would leave Douai forty-seven minutes after them, lucky you.
    Valou will arrive at nine hours and one minute at Paris-Lyon, and Rémi and you will arrive seven minutes later in two different stations, Paris-Montparnasse and Paris-Nord, respectively.

    You chose to meet each other at the Châtelet metro station, which is accessible from all three train stations via a single metro trip with no transfers.
    From there, you can take line 1 to La Défense and stop at Franklin D. Roosevelt to transfer to line 9 and stop at Pont de Sèvres, its terminus, two blocks away from the Seguin island.


    While you review the Paris metro map to try to learn this trip by heart, look at maps of the factory in the show and pictures of the car factory from before its destruction,
    and compare them to the less than a year old entertainment building that replaced it, you hear another familiar beep.

    Willing to try again to benefit from the magic regeneration of your banknotes during returns to the past,
    you do something nobody knowing the true price of food items would ever do: you get up from your seat, nonchalantly abandoning your luggage, and go for the restaurant car, a bit further to the rear of the train.


    Hoping you'd get to enjoy an extremely expensive meal, you discover the restaurant services are not available on trains of the northern high speed line.
    Too bad. You still have a seat on one of the stools on this empty car, turn on your phone and start a video call with Valou and Rémi, to keep yourselves company and stay in touch in case anything goes wrong.

    Two minutes before nine.


    you hear through the phone’s speaker that Valou is getting an annoucement about his arrival at Paris-Lyon, you express your surprise that nothing is going wrong during this trip.


    You will have to learn to keep your mouth shut, because you immediately hear a loud noise, like some friction and folding of metal parts.
    Thinking it is your train that is about to derail, you cover your face with your hands and get in a fetal position.

    You and Valou try to call Rémi, as his phone’s camera now is filming the sky.
    After a solid minute, he picks up the phone from the ground and talks to you again.
    His train derailed. He got thrown out of the window and crashed on some grass that absorbed a part of the shock.
    He is a bit stunned. While explaining what happened, he sees the train driver running away from the locomotive while screaming, and screams too when said locomotive blows up.

    Saturday, thirty-three minutes past eight ante meridiem.


    You turn on your phone and restart the video call.
    Valou answers immediately, but Rémi takes some time. After a few stressful seconds, he answers and says he is fine, but certainly not everyone is.
    In the background, you hear people crying in front of the corpses of their relatives, killed in a fire that never happened.
