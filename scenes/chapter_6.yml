    You don't see anything out of the ordinary during your journey to the Seguin island.
    You looked around for four fifty-one minutes intervals, or two flashes, and there has not been a single incident. A very unusual serenity reigns, maybe the calm before the storm.
  answers:
    "A strong gust of wind scares you": {}

    For a second, you belive the authors of those phenomena heard your thoughts and are taking your expressions literally.
    But it was just some wind; it went back to its state of night breeze as you were leaning on a barrier of the Daydé bridge,
    contemplating the Seine and holding a walkie-talkie in your left hand.

    You were waiting for your friends to tell you they found something, as you did not find anything yourself, not a single signal, no strange presence, not even a bad feeling.

    Seventeen minutes before seven post meridiem.


    In a few moments, you will be dazzled again by a big white flash in the middle of the night. Your talkie illuminates its screen in a deep blue color to indicate an incoming transmission
    as Valou speaks up and tries to call. But his words are blocked by another noise, something that sounds like a digital transmission from a more powerful source.
  answers:
    "A white flash dazzles just as planned": {}

    Saturday, the twenty-fourth of December, seven minutes before six post meridiem, post-flash span.


    You are lost in the middle of a small street of the Seguin island, so you open up my phone’s GPS application to learn about your location. You turn the talkie on again and immediately hear Valou and Rémi trying to call you.

    You answer and tell them your position. Later, you meet again at the hotel room. Both you and Rémi had heard the foreign transmission, but not Valou, as he was transmitting himself.

ch6-5:

    Therefore, you bring out your headphones and listen to many sample recordings of digital transmissions available on web pages dedicated to identifying signals.
    Rémi, who started at the bottom of the list to make the search faster, thinks that what what you heard was a Packet Radio signal.
  answers:
    "You listen to the sample and immediately confirm": {}

ch6-6:
  text: >
    Valou proceeds to explain everything you need to do capture this signal. If it is linked to the flashes, you'll be able to analyze it for less than a second each time, and if it actually is Packet Radio,
    a piece of software on Valou’s laptop will decode it as quickly as possible.

ch6-7:
  text: >
    Saturday, the twenty-fourth of December, one minute before eleven post meridiem, post-flash span.


    You write as quickly as you can everything you remember after this sixth flash of looking at what Valou’s program has shown.
    You manage to finally decode the full message: an IPv6 packet, from an address linked to nobody on Earth, sent as a broadcast message, which will not really help identifying it,
    but transmitting via UDP a payload that can be decoded as "SCIPIO".


    You don't need any more details to know where to go. You compare some maps and drawings of the old factory to get the GPS coordinates of where we think the elevator should be, and you take your scooter,
    your hiking GPS and your coat as all of you head off to the Seguin island to try to see what happens in there in the ninety-seven minutes left before the next return to the past.

ch6-8:
  text: >
    You cross the Daydé bridge and move one of the fences that prevent you from entering the construction site.
    The Seine musicale only occupies a part of the island; everything else still holds some remains of the old factory’s demolition.


    You go along the edge of the island, lights turned off to not be seen, and you see far away on the river an inflatable boat from the fluvial police brigade.
  answers:
    "Lay on the ground and wait for a few minutes": {}

ch6-9:

    One you're certain that they went away, you get up again and keep walking, until you find a large gray tarp that seems to cover up a hole, held to the ground by some orange duct tape.


    You don't waste any time and just tear it off. You fold the scooter and put it on your shoulder using its strap after noticing an elevator shaft you already know about, lit up by neon lights,
    with a ladder on one of its sides. You go down the ladder one after the other, and after a few minutes of going down, you reach a metallic green blast-proof door closed by super-clamps ending in an arc
    and holding a large locking system.


    Rémi, who went down the ladder first, was the closest to the door, and tried to find a way to open it. He noticed a red handle, way too red and shiny to be old,
    on the left edge of the door. After showing it to you, and after reflecting for a moment, he decides to hang himself on the last bar of the ladder, now only held by the force of his arms.

ch6-10:
  text: >
    He dangles there for a few moments, which only made your fear of this void even worse.


    He then manages to put his right foot on the edge of an iron plate, painted with yellow and black diagonal stripes and surrounding the door.


    Rémi takes a deep breath, has a close look at how his foot is put on the plate, then lets go of the ladder. His other foot quickly joins the other on the plate,
    and he gets a hold of one of the clamps that hold the door with his hands. He then starts moving horizontally, sliding his feet on the plate slowly.
    You start to get a little dizzy while looking at what is underneath
  answers:
    "Raise your head and wait": {}

ch6-11:
  text: >
    Finally, a he a grinding noise and a click is heard, followed by a short scream of Rémi who visibly did not plan on loosing his points of support when the lock got out of its slot,
    made a quarter turn after getting its grooves filled by electric arcs, and the clamps released their hold to let the door slide open. The whole process made so much metallic noise that it left you wondering
    when will someone notice you being here.

ch6-12:
  text: >
    Rémi waves at you to come down and helps you to enter the newly opened room and discover the new environment.
    The same metallic green plates, imperfectly placed all around the room, leaving grooves everywhere, some thick cables on the ground and an impressive bundle of cables and tubes from the ceiling,
    all connected to a terminal with four screens and an old-school keyboard, all lit up by the greenish glow from an holographic system showing a mesh globe holding a virtual world made of four sectors evenly placed around a fifth.
    There is no doubt that we cannot be anywhere else than in the lab of the supercomputer you dreamed to see.

ch6-13:
  text: >
    As the holographic system is active, you deduce that the supercomputer is already turned on. You get closer to the vintage armchair in front of the screens. There starts a debate about who will be the one to
    try what this thing can do.


    At some point, you get tired of that debate and just get on the seat. Rémi and Valou  were about to protest, but immediately calm down and focus on the screens when they hear the noise of the terminal booting up.
    You see the supercomputer’s interface initialize itself in front of your amazed eyes, and then... nothing. You are too scared to type anything.
    Considering the situation, pressing any key could trigger anything, like closing the doors and leaving you in here forever or triggering an alarm.

ch6-14:

    Luckily, the terminal that you know more about opens up, and you are surprised to see a dollar sign next to the blinking cursor.
  answers:
    "Terminal": { TERM: "inside-factory" }

#     After some simple command typing, we found out that we had a terabyte of RAM available, and that the nuclear cell that powers the supercomputer is almost full, with only two percents of its capacity used and five years of estimated battery life. With more advanced commands, we found out about the virtualization and virtual world recreation programs.

#     While Valou and I were helping each other with our ancestral knowledge of Linux witchcraft to find what interests us the most at the moment, the origin of those flashes, Rémi, who does not understand what we are doing, goes back to trigger the red handle when he starts hearing noise coming from outside. We certainly were not very quiet. We will have to be quick.

#     The door closes and locks itself while we manage to find the super-scan program. Running it gave us nothing. I then think about having a look at the logs; if this whole supercomputer runs Linux it must have some good log files to look at to know what is going on.

# ch6-24:

#     The log files reveal to us that the supercomputer effectively receives the Scipio code sent via Packet Radio and seems to trigger a return to the past on this command. The next log entries are a huge mess of unintelligible error messages and warnings linked to programs that we do not know anything about.

#     The Kadikeon, a small window on the bottom-right corner of the main screen that shows the factory’s CCTV cameras, only shows one camera out of the four it usually shows, as the others probably got destroyed with the factory’s demolition. The single active camera shows that some men in suits with sunglasses, a very strange choice of outfit in the middle of a winter night, are going down the ladder.

# ch6-26:

#     I pause for a few seconds before asking Valou to get his laptop and his walkie-talkie out while I plug in a USB key to the terminal and get on the seat. He proceeds but does not really understand. A grin is drawn on his face after he has a look at the commands I am typing.
#
#
# ch6-27:
#   text: >
#     Once my little trick is done, I ask Valou to trigger the Scipio code. He turns on his talkie and prepares his laptop to send the code, while Rémi tries to ask me about what I plan to do.

#     Too late to answer; an ear-splitting sound of digital transmission is heard in the room and the resource usage levels shown on the supercomputer’s screens get full. After a few seconds, right as we hear the door unlocking, a flash gets triggered, on this Saturday, the twenty-fourth of December, at five minutes before midnight, Central European Time.
