    Fourteen minutes past ten ante meridiem, Central European Time, pre-flash span.
  answers:
    "You decide, knowing that you'll be in this MF-01 again after a flash at five minutes past eleven, to get off the train, go outside and have some fresh air while hoping to not experience another railroad accident": {}

    Because of the time you've lost with the terrorist attack, you didn't go further than the Alma-Marceau station.


    Since you are close to it, you head towards the Alma bridge.
    And "close" means you just had to cross a road. You find a good point of view and have a look at the well-known Zouave
    (which is a French word for a funny, eccentric person, the Alma bridge's Zouave is a statue next to one of the bridge's pillars, often used as a reference by TV news when the Seine river starts rising in the event of a flood),
    not knowing it would become famous again in French TV news in just a month.

ch5-3:
  text: >
    You have a look at your phone, then cross the bridge and reach its south end.
    Valou and Rémi do not understand why, and your lack of answers to their questions intrigues them, but they follow me anyway.
    You get closer to a corner of the bridge, think for a bit, then look at your surroundings. You gesture your friends to act normal,
    like all of you are waiting for someone here.
  answers:
    "You reach out to a metallic part of the bridge, fumble a bit, and get a small box out of it": {}

ch5-4:
  text: >
    When you have some time to loose in Paris, you either make some “artistic” photos to keep to yourself, or do some geocaching.
    You write your name in the logbook inside the box. You know that it will get erased during the next flash, but you still do it just for the pleasure of logging a geocache,
    then put everything back as it was, act like you are waiting again, and put the box back in its spot.
  answers:
    "Leave the bridge, while explaining to Rémi what Geocaching is": {}

    You keep going on the little stroll you've been doing and wander around the Quai Branly gardens.
    After a good half an hour of walking between patches of grass, and happy that you are not having any trouble so far, you reach the Eiffel Tower.
    You buy some overpriced waffles at a nearby food truck, knowing that the money you've just spent will be back in your wallets later, and chat while eating them.
    You take the opportunity to show off the knowledge about the tower you learnt from an episode of C’est pas sorcier (an emblematic educational TV show that aired between 1993 and 2014 on French TV)
    and still remember.

ch5-6:
  text: >
    Three minutes before eleven, local time.


    Only eight minutes before the next flash.


    You completely forgot about the fact that no trouble has happened for so long.

    As you finish eating your waffles, which admittedly were quite tasty, a very loud metallic sound, like a very strong friction or way too noisy brakes, is heard from two different places.
    Of the four elevators of the Eiffel tower, two were at the bottom, one of them open to passengers, and two others were up high.
    Of course, those last two are the ones that started screeching; sparks were coming out from their contact points with the tower’s iron bars, and they were falling at a high speed.
  answers:
    "The cables holding them seem to have failed": {}


ch5-7:
  text: >
    Both elevators ended up crashing on the ground in a loud boom.


    You could feel the vibrations in your feet. But again, the biggest incident was not those elevators, but the movement of panic that followed.


    Suddenly, all the anxiousness that accumulated from the past incidents into this crowd of tourists, who chose to ignore them just to try to enjoy their Christmas Eve by going to the Eiffel tower,
    got released into cries of fear and running around. Seeing everyone start to flee another possible danger, we chose to run as well, not to flee another dangerous situation but to flee those people themselves,
    who will cause even more casualties in their panic.
  answers:
    "Flee": {}

ch5-8:
  text: >
    In six minutes, you should be able to get out of this safely.
    You try to go back to the Quai Branly esplanades, hoping that nobody will try to go sit in another park and instead chose to run along the Champ de Mars.

    That wish is only partially fulfilled, as some noticed you moving in a different direction and followed. With your scooter, you easily manage to outpace them, and see Rémi and Valentin hiding somewhere.
  asnwers:
    "Once you are sure that you're no longer followed, you go back to find them and decide to stay there, under the porch they found, waiting for the time warp": {}

ch5-9:
  text: >
    You witness some other tourists running then stopping out of exhaustion, realising that nothing is happening, that they actually fled nothing.

    It is one of the other characteristics of incidents: they are atomic, meaning they are not made of multiple elements or events.
    People lost the limits of their egoism at Lille-Flandres, there has been a bus accident, an explosion in a building, pigs went mad, a train derailed, and elevators fell.
  answers:
    "Everything else is just a consequence of those events": {}

ch5-10:
  text: >
    The flash at five minutes past eleven happens just as expected. You are back in the metro again. Some passengers express that they're already quite tired of this,
    but you are glad to know that you can keep going on the route for fifty-one more minutes without having to witness worse situations than you already had.

    Twenty-four minutes before eleven.


    Alleluia! After many adventures, you finally managed to reach line 9’s terminus, Pont de Sèvres.


    You stop at a fast-food place that just opened, since you have been awake for nearly ten hours now, even if only five went by.
    You eat your “dinner” while walking along the Seine, from which you really liked the kefta panini with barbecue sauce, and you are quite happy to finally get to see the Seguin island for real,
    the island of your childhood dreams. It changed a lot, with this huge glass dome and a garden. You keep walking and take the time to get some pictures of the Daydé bridge,
    the bridge that inspired the one the heroes of the show took to access the factory.

ch5-12:
  text: >
    In said show, the heroes went underground, in the sewers, to reach the bridge from their school. You quickly reach the bridge by riding your scooter and notice there really is a manhole leading to it.
    You take another picture, then go back to the street. After all that happened this morning, you choose to go to a hotel, two streets away, to rest for a bit and get ready to investigate later.

  answers:
    "You manage to reach it at eleven o’clock": {}

ch5-13:
  text: >
    You get in, and even though it is very early in the day, the very friendly manager gives you the keys and leads to your room.
    Two separated beds, with another one above them, a private bathroom, a TV with cable, everything any average hotel has.

    And you didn't even have to pay anything, since you booked the room before a flash, so your money got returned, but the manager still confirmed the booking and did not notice anything.
    You might also be able to enjoy the breakfast buffet if you manage to get to it during actual breakfast hours.
  answers:
    "As there is no time to enjoy your little trickery for now, you lay in your beds": {}

ch5-14:
  text: >
    Five minutes past eleven.


    Your phone makes a little beep noise, you get up and finish unpacking my belongings in the room.
    Rémi and Valou follow along. The goal was to still be in bed after the next flash, to make sure you do not get woken up by falling on the street next to the Seine.
  anwers:
    "Go back to bed": {}

ch5-15:
  text: >
    You dream of going down a ladder in this manhole, to walk in it as if you did that routinely and it was engraved in your subconscious autopilot, and reaching an old building.
    You understood it was the dorms building of the show’s school. You look around one of the hallways. Every door of every bedroom was open, and in each of them were white people with black hair, wearing headphones,
    quickly typing on a keyboard in front of them, their silhouette only lit up by the blueish light coming from their screen. They were all wearing U.S. army outfits, and you did too.
  answers:
    "Wake up before getting to learn anything more, because of another flash": {}

ch5-16:
  text: >
    You wake Rémi and Valou up, and you quickly get some breakfast, served by the manager who agreed to cook some at this time of the day due to the very wonky rhythm these flashes give people.

    Twenty-five minutes before four post meridiem.


    You get back to business right after the breakfast; you'll wait for the pre-flash span at eleven minutes past four to keep going on your “morning” routines.
  answers:
    "You start by doing some research on the five incidents that should have happened in the eight hours and twenty minutes of sleep you got, compressed into less than four hours": {}

ch5-18:
  text: >
    The four first are quickly found on news sites; some riots in Marseille, many drivers loosing control of their cars and driving into banks,
    a fire evacuation exercise at a high school that goes into another wave of panic, and some waggons falling off a ride in a theme park.
    Information about the last incident comes by a little slower, as it happened right before the last flash.


    You focus on the location of those incidents; none of them happened in your region, or near places you live. However, since the beginning, almost every incident seemed to happen in a way that affects you specifically.
    You'd  be very surprised that anyone else than you have physically witnessed almost every incident.
  answers:
    "Fearing that you might get a little too egocentric, you chose to not care about that, just to make a little comment on it to your friends and move on": {}

ch5-19:
  text: >
    You kept working until around five o’clock, in a post-flash span, right after the first flash of the night.
    You want to wait until nighttime to investigate more discreetly and possibly follow some suspicious people around the island.


    The plan is to try every single possibliity: scan for Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth devices or radio transmissions around the island, analyze the electrical network, and maybe even try to map out the sewers.
  answers:
    "Equipped with your phones, two talkie-walkies, a ThinkPad with a brand new Kali Linux setup, flashlights, paper, pencils, food and drinks, you went out to chase every possible clue on the Seguin island and its surroundings, at eighteen minutes past five post meridiem, Central European Time, on this Saturday, the twenty-fourth of December.": { SCENE: ch6-1 }
