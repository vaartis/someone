    Saturday, the twenty-fourth of December, nineteen minutes before nine ante meridiem, Central European Time, post-flash span.


    It took a few minutes for Rémi to calm down enough from the derailment he lived through, and its consequences.
    You explain to him over the phone that the only way we have to at least make sure this does not keep happening,
    or at most restore everything just as it was before the flashes, is to investigate.
    Maybe your theory is just some far-fetched hypothesis made by some show fans, but maybe you will find something; the only way to know is to act.

    Two minutes before nine.


    After an annoucement made by a visibly angry agent, to explain to the passengers of my northern train, complaining about the delay again,
    that there has been deaths in another high speed train and it could have been them just as likely as those who were on the train, you hear through the phone’s speaker
    another annoucement in Rémi’s train, stating that a psychological support group has been set up at Montparnasse, and sending sincere condolences to everyone.


    You indeed did not think about it. The returns to the past do not erase people's memories, therefore people's behaviors. With the physical damages can also come psychological damage;
    how would one react if unexplained supernatural events caused one of your relatives to die, or if one witnesses a cruel and unthinkable death of dozens of people around themsef,
    only leaving behind memories and lifeless bodies, without evidence, without culprits?


    Rémi stops your thoughts by telling you he is about to end the call and get ready to leave the train
  answers:
    "You quickly remind him to take line 4 to Porte de Clignancourt and wait for you at Châtelet, and, more importantly, wish him good luck": {}

    Nine hours and nine minutes, at Paris-Nord’s clock.


    Your train slowly enters the station and stops. The doors open and you are one of the first to get out.
    Because the train has multiple units, which means two trains have been attached one to the other, you are far from the main hall, a few hundred meters,
    which is enough justification to ignore some French train station rules and use your scooter to move on the platform faster.
  answers:
    "Enter the main hall and go to the escalators towards the metro": {}

    It is pretty natural for you to make your way inside those tunnels, as you have always found Paris’ metro signage easy to understand.
    You quickly find a ticket vending machine and get a pack of ten tickets. This time, the banknotes will not regenerate magically, but it is for a good cause.
  asnwers:
    "After the machine is done spitting a dozen bits of striped paper, you enter the tunnels to line 4, towards Mairie de Montrouge": {}

    You lose a few seconds due to some travelers trying to go through the turnstiles with heavy luggage, but manage to reach the platform.


    As expected, Parisians are too busy with their jobs, even on a twenty-fourth of December, and their behaviour is not a single bit influenced by what has been happening for over twenty-four hours.
    They are waiting with a jaded look. A well-known voice echoes through the stations to relax those who were getting too impatient:
    “Heading to Mairie de Montrouge, next train in one minute.” Around a minute later, a MP89CA shows up and opens its doors.
    Regulars are more disciplined than in Lille; they give way to passengers getting off the metro, understanding it will give them space to get on.

    Sixteen minutes past nine.


    As the train starts going after the doors have closed, you notice while sensing your phone vibration that you still have cellular coverage.
    With two little metro lines, people in Lille are surely not getting this luxury.


    Valou is telling you that he is on the metro as well, and he is making a trip between just two stations. You answer that he will have to wait for you and Rémi.
    You look at your flash notification application and it states that you only have seven minutes left before a pre-flash span.
    You'll have to wait together at Châtelet before being able to get back on the route, just to not have to do it twice.

    This plan could have gone perfectly if the train did not suddenly come to a stop after the Réamur Sébastopol station, just before Étienne Marcel, the last station before Châtelet.


    You ask Rémi if something is wrong for him too, as he is on the same line as you towards the opposite direction, and he tells that his vehicle is staying at the Cité station, right before Châtelet, and not moving.
  answers:
    "No need to be an expert detective to deduce something is happening at Châtelet": {}

ch4-8:
  text: >
    Twenty-minutes past nine.


    The pre-flash span should start at twenty-three past nine. There are two possibilities: either it is an incident related to the returns to the past,
    and the duration between them is shortening, or it is not, and something worse happened.

ch4-9:
  text: >
    The crackling of a speaker and the quick speaking of a train traffic controller tells that a bomb explosion at Châtelet is the origin of the disruption.
    Vehicles will start moving again once the emergency services will state there is no more danger and the line will be able to restart without stopping at Châtelet.


    Since this announcement does not help in any way to choose one of the two explanations you came up with, you find it more useful to have a look at your Paris metro map again and look for alternative trips.
    Valou confirms he got the same announcement as you did and you answer him Rémi and you are both fine.
  answers:
    "After some map reading, you tell them both the new paths for everyone": {}

ch4-10:

    You will join Rémi and stay on the fourth line to reach the Strasbourg-Saint-Denis station.
    The two of you will then take line 9 to Saint Augustin, where you'll wait for Valou who will join by staying on his line until Saint-Lazare,
    where according to the plan it is possible to reach Saint Augustin by foot easily. You will then keep going according to the initial plan towards the island.

ch4-11:
  text: >
    Now that this is taken care of, all that is left for you to do is to wait. You rejoice again in the presence of phone antennas underground here and browse the web.
    If the theory about the flashes and their duration is still true, the next flash will be in forty-four minutes.


    For about twenty minutes, you try to find information about the explosion. Trying their best to filter what people say on Twitter and avoid misinformation,
    some have tried to sum up the situation. You see some comments are being sent to your blog about an article you wrote on the theory for returns to the past;
    people are starting to believe. One of the commenters suggest the terrorists may have been much cleverer than their very low average and made use of the flashes to worsen their impact on western countries.


    Passengers from your train with which you have engaged a conversation seem to agree with this idea, and in fact, unexplained accidents with fatalities are a blessing for terrorists.
    According to the first news from trustable enough sources, a single man entered the station, went to the main hall, screamed “Allah Akbar” and exploded.


    This is by far the simplest and most efficient way to perform a terrorist attack; walk like every other passenger with a jaded look, at a fast pace, but run only when walking on stairs.
    Walk past French army soldiers stuck in train stations and other public places without a right to check anyone’s identity or search their belongings, and blow yourself up without waiting,
    without giving anyone the time to stop you or shoot at you, and without leaving luggage for bomb squads. In short, use the simplest vulnerabilities of the French anti-terrorist scam.

ch4-12:
  text: >
    The short political speech in your thoughts ends with another annoucement from the train traffic controller, telling that trains will start running again without stopping at Châtelet.
    But you did not expect him to tell that this will happen in more than thirty minutes, therefore far after the flash you are expecting. But if there still is a bit of truth in your theory
    about returns to the past at fixed intervals, then it truly is an incident where someone is making use of those time travels, not another “usual” incident; because you already would have gone through
    another flash to erase this terrorist attack.

ch4-13:
  text: >
    Thirteen minutes past ten.


    It is time to put the theory to the test again. Rémi and Valou are both in the same situation as you are: waiting for their train to start moving again.
    Your latest findings show this attack has a bigger death toll than every other incident this far: a hundred deaths, caused by both the explosion and the wave of panic that followed.
    Jostles, tramplings while the crowd tries to run away, people falling down stairs, or falling on rails while third rail electrification is still active. Almost all survivors from this huge mess are heavily wounded.

ch4-14:

    A passenger in your train is getting angry and starts shouting while trying to call the traffic controllers via the intercom, saying it is always the same,
    saying they are going to evacuate the train and make people walk in the tunnel without ever giving financial compensation, etc.
  answers:
    "Fortunately for you and your ears, the return to the past happens just as planned": {}

    Twenty-three minutes past nine ante meridiem, Central European Time, post-flash span.


    You are still stuck in this train, but before the passenger has another chance to express his rage, the train traffic controller speaks up again and announces traffic will move forward in just a few minutes,
    since the situation is already taken care of by the police and they probably are also getting tired of spending more time in this station filled with corpses.


    While patiently waiting for your liberation, you realize something; there was a seemingly unrelated to the flashes terrorist attack, since it happened unexpectedly during a “calm” moment,
    but there has not been any real incident, one where you go back in time to see people dead before the time they actually died. This raises many questions in your brain.


    Are the creators of those time travels linked in any way to terrorism?


    Maybe they share common objectives, so they aborted their own incident and let jihadist propaganda earn more credibility?

  answers:
    "Share those thoughts on social media, hoping, even if you don't really believe it, that someone could share a hint": {}

    At worst, it could just make the people behind this laugh a bit, in a way similar to Fantomas.
    You feel slightly pushed to the rear and see, to both yours and everyone else's delight, that the train is moving again.


    You manage to get off at Étienne Marcel and take the same line in the other direction to join Strasbourg-Saint-Denis,
    while making sure to avoid journalists, waiting for people at every station near Châtelet to get an interview with people who survived a flash inside a tunnel at any

ch4-17:

    Rémi’s train moves again too, in the right direction.
    You are in the train right in front of his, without him even knowing about it. Valou is still on his seat, lucky him, and is patiently waiting to reach Saint-Lazare.


    You hope that at least the plan B will work as intended.

ch4-18:
  text:
    A calm pre-recorded voice announces Strasbourg-Saint-Denis twice.


    The doors open, you get off and find the hallways leading to transfers, since you'll be taking line 9 later. You sit on a bench while waiting for Rémi,
    who arrives a few minutes later. In the usual madness between the two of you, you both say hi to each other with a very accentuated Parisian accent and kiss each other’s cheek,
    then go to line 9’s platforms.

ch4-19:
  text: >
    After Rémi told you that he is amazement at how easy it is for you to find your way in these stations, even with your completely inexistent sense of direction, you reach your platform.


    You don't even have to wait, the MF-01 is already here. You miss the MP89 a bit, your favorite model of Paris metro trains, but a vehicle that is not on tires is better for the lungs,
    since disc brakes generate a lot of pollution in this confined space.


    You find seats relatively easily, and chat all the way to Saint-Augustin, where you get off and wait for Valou outside.
    You had to wait this time, since Valou seemed to get a bit lost, which is understandable considering the strange transfer he has to make near a train station right after a terrorist attack
    happened on the public transit network, but he manages to find you. Valou and Rémi get to know each other, and you exchange some more salutations before getting back on the route.
