    Once again, the morning comes around and you find yourself in bed alone, Narra obviously getting up earlier.

    When you get up and go to the kitchen, to your surprise you don't find Narra there, nor in the living room.

    After you come back to the kitchen, you notice, looking out of the window, that she's outside talking with Maj.
    There's a sizable backpack on the floor nearby. You go outside to join them, Narra waves at you, as she notices you approaching.

    So.. While you've been sleeping in, we've been talking about something we could do today: looking around inside that cave
    < if state_variables.day3.forest_search.other_parts.caves then >
    we visited, but didn't go in
    < else >
    I mentioned

    yesterday before we found Kiki.

    well, you see.. we've only ever gone there a long time ago, when we just found out what fire is. the trip was documented, of course,
    but not exactly too well, it was quite difficult with what was available at the time, and afterwards everyone seemed to just lose interest
    in it, because it was dark and dank and nobody wants to go there even if there's probably no danger in doing it.

    Probably?

    well, you never know.. so, i though you two should go and look around again with some of the new equipment i got. i could go with you,
    of course, but i'd rather coordinate this whole thing from here with these handy things..

    He rifles through the backpack and pulls out three small black devices, handing them to both of you, and leaving one to himself. Inside the
    backpack, you can also see another one, that takes the rest of available space in the backpack.

    basically, these things allow us to communicate remotely and without having to put a long wire between the two places. i've set this up a while ago,
    and there's a base station here in the village. the range is alright, but it can't pierce through super thick things like mountains so you'll have
    to take this retranslator in the backpack with you. it's a bit heavy but nothing too bad, i'm sure you'll manage. it has a battery that should
    last you for some time. set it up at the entrace of the cave, and we should be able to communicate when you're inside. i've also prepared an
    electrical lamp for you. sorry, only one lamp because the backpack is already heavy, so you'll have to stick
    together. look around for anything interesting while you're in there of course, but please remember to document it on the map too.

    Alright then, take that backpack and let's go then, hopefully we'll discover something interesting along with mapping the place.

    You sigh and take the backpack. It is a bit heavy, but as Maj sad, nothing too bad. The walk to the cave proves a bit more difficult
    with it, as you have to ascend some ground to get there, and you make a few stops to rest, but it is otherwise uneventful. Once there,
    you putting what Maj called the retranslator at the mouth of the cave and press the only big red button it has. The machine confirms
    with a loud beep that it is on. With that, you turn the lamp on and enter the cave.
