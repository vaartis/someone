    Right.. This clears thing up a bit. Conserving power must be important in such a situation. And I don't remember
    anything before my life here, that much is obvious, they clearly knew about this. Still, there must've been no other
    choice if that was the necessary sacrifice for me to live. The initials aren't exactly helpful, though, we still
    have no idea who that person is. Still they clearly cared about us enough to set up all this.. elaborate way of
    showing you around and doing all of the.. digitizing process in the first place.

    Pretty much. You'll have to put some work in, get to those upper levels and continue from there, and hopefully you
    can save the day. I believe you can do it. I'm sure you understand I want to live and see my friends just as much.

    Clearly, a way to go outside somehow, and probably a way to access the power supply. Must be why they
    were so cautious of letting you go up there.

      Hopefully there's also equipment for the task. But besides that, what else could be there..  Probably some place
      of living, maybe the place where this whole thing was developed in. Though I'm not sure about the uh.. server
      it's running on. Maybe that one's somewhere lower, actually, deeper where it's protected from whatever is
      happening outside.

upper-3:

    Sorry, I don't understand too much of how these computer things work, but I suppose putting it away from everything
    else would be the safest choice in case something goes really badly on the upper levels or the outside.
    Perhaps there's something to spend your time on up there, like you know, to not go insane from all the work?

    right. well, i was here all the time. very interesting, indeed. so, it's not exactly out of question that it is
    possible to say, scan someone's body with some sort of advanced techology to perfectly or very nearly perfectly
    replicate it in a computer program. it'd take a while, sure, and the techology needed for such a thing must really
    be unique. i can't even begin to imagine how much time and resources this must have taken. and that's not even
    touching the part where all of this needs very specific software and hardware developed from scratch, since it's
    such an intricate and complicated process. this person clearly was some sort of genius to do this, and i must admit,
    i admire them even more greatly for this. still, geniuses make mistakes too, and clearly don't live forever when it
    comes to your world. i can understand not wanting to forget all the work you've done on this techology, since there
    would be nobody else besides you who knows how everything works. they're probably gone now, so that is the case
    either way. you, and i mean <= state_variables.input_variables.p >, will have to figure something out for this, if
    you want to.. well, i suppose come live here with us. this must be what they meant by saving yourself.

    That's a.. complicated topic. Of course, on one hand I want to know. On the other hand, I may have been a completely
    different person. The two of us may.. conflict. I don't really want to think about this right now, we have enough
    problems already besides this. It can probably wait.

    alright, you've been there for a while. i'll be waiting, maybe tell me when you're nearby so i can put the kettle on

    You trace back your steps to the entrance of the cave. When you're out of the cave, it's evening already.
    You put the big device and the lamp back into the backpack and head home. The note, still in your hand,
    goes into the backpack, too.

    Guess Maj was right about us being in there for a long time. Time sure flies.

    Yeah, still don't really get it.

    I don't really understand how that works, I guess computers can do that?
    Maj'd probably understand this, but I don't really want to bother him.

    Hey, we're almost there. Did you get Kiki already?

    Indeed, I am here. I've been busy with my plants at home, as usual.
    < if state_variables.day4.morning_talk_with_kiki then >
    <= state_variables.input_variables.p> told me about your plans to map out the cave in the morning,
    < else >
    Maj mentioned your plans to map out the cave briefly when I came around during the day to say hi,
    < end >
    so I'd rather like to hear how your little trip to that old cave went.

    After a few more minutes, you get to Maj's house and go in as usual, unsurprisingly finding Maj and Kiki in the
    kitchen sipping tea already. You both sit at the table, Maj pours you some tea. Since he's boiled the water
    beforehand, it's not too hot by now, in fact it's of perfect drinking temperature, so you both have some.

16:
  char: narra
  text: >-
    So.. Cutting to the chase, Maj suggested we go explore that old cave with an actual lamp this time. Since,
    you know, nobody's been there in a while, it wasn't exactly very interesting.

17:
  char: kiki
  text: >-
    < if state_variables.day4.morning_talk_with_kiki then >
    Yes, <= state_variables.input_variables.p> mentioned something like this.
    < else >
    I see.
    < end >
    So, did you find anything intersting in there?

18:
  char: narra

  text: >-
    Well, turns out someone.. called W.S., whatever these initials are supposed to mean, has left a note in there some time ago.
    For <= state_variables.input_variables.p>, mostly, but some bits were about me, too. It must've been the creator,
    obviously, there isn't anyone else who could have done something like that. I'll just.. give you the note to read
    yourself.

19:
  char: description
  text: >-
    Narra takes the note out of the backback, and Kiki takes some time to read and re-read the note, then returns it.

20:
  char: kiki
  text: >-
    What a.. peculiar situation. Well, <= state_variables.input_variables.p>, we're counting on you. Though it is clearly
    in your best interest to do it for yourself, too. The creator.. they really were a genius, it's a shame it had to
    end like this, but what's done is done, that's what they decided for themselves and, in part, for you. It's a
    responsibility, of course, but I believe you can manage it.

21:
  char: player

    Now, I think I'll head home back to my sweeties. Maj, I must say, your tea is delicious, as usual.

    thank you. it's really nothing special, but i try my best.

    You say your goodbyes and leave, going home. Narra has a bath, as usual, and meets you in the bedroom,
