    face.

    Right.. This clears thing up a bit. Conserving power must be important in such a situation. And I don't remember
    anything before my life here, that much is obvious, they clearly knew about this. Still, there must've been no other
    choise if that was the necessary sacrifice for me to live. The initials aren't exactly helpful, though, we still
    have no idea who that person is. Still they clearly cared about us enough to set up all this.. elaborate way of
    showing you around and doing all of the.. digitizing process in the first place.

    It's probably not great out there if you're hidden so deep inside this place.

      Yeah. Definetely not good outside. Still, I don't think I have much of a choice
      if I want to live.

      And not spend my life here eating canned peaches every day.

    Pretty much. You'll have to put some work in, get to those upper levels and continue from there, and hopefully you
    can save the day. I believe you can do it. I'm sure you understand I want to live and see my friends just as much.

    Clearly, a way to go outside somehow, and probably a way to access the power supply. Must be why they
    were so cautious of letting you go up there.

      Hopefully there's also equipment for the task. But besides that, what else could be there..  Probably some place
      of living, maybe the place where this whole thing was developed in. Though I'm not sure about the uh.. server
      it's running on. Maybe that one's somewhere lower, actually, deeper where it's protected from whatever is
      happening outside.

  text: >-
    Sorry, I don't understand too much of how these computer things work, but I suppose putting it away from everything
    else would be the safest choice in case something goes really badly on the upper levels or the outside.
    Perhaps there's something to spend your time on up there, like you know, to not go insane from all the work?

    right. well, i was here all the time. very interesting, indeed. so, it's not exactly out of question that it is
    possible to say, scan someone's body with some sort of advanced techology to perfectly or very nearly perfectly
    replicate it in a computer program. it'd take a while, sure, and the techology needed for such a thing must really
    be unique. i can't even begin to imagine how much time and resources this must have taken. and that's not even
    touching the part where all of this needs very specific software and hardware developed from scratch, since it's
    such an intricate and complicated process. this person clearly was some sort of genius to do this, and i must admit,
    i admire them even more greatly for this. still, geniuses make mistakes too, and clearly don't live forever when it
    comes to your world. i can understand not wanting to forget all the work you've done on this techology, since there
    would be nobody else besides you who knows how everything works. they're probably gone now, so that is the case
    either way. you, and i mean <= state_variables.input_variables.p >, will have to figure something out for this, if
    you want to.. well, i suppose come live here with us. this must be what they meant by saving yourself.

    That's a.. complicated topic. Of course, on one hand I want to know. On the other hand, I may have been a completely
    different person. The two of us may.. conflict. I don't really want to think about this right now, we have enough
    problems already besides this. It can probably wait.
