    Well, you did something, and now there's the forest. That is what i was talking about when I told you that there was more. This forest is
    a fraction of it. This is where we all woke up.

    There were. I don't know if they're still here. It's been some time since there was anything here. But now you're here at least. And the forest is
    back too.

    We all found ourselves here just like you did, with no memory of what happened or who we are. When I found myself here, there was nobody else
    around. It was pretty lonely, the only thing I would do is walk through the forest, looking around for anything to do at all. With time though, more
    people came, just like me, with no memories about anything before the moment they woke up. They found themselves in this very forest. They went
    looking for something to do, like i did, and eventually met the others. There were all kinds of creatures appearing, too. Some of them were very
    much sentient, like me and you, some were more animal-like, just following instincts. What seemed to connect them was that they all were just as
    confused.

    Something. I'm not sure what exactly happened, but it seemed like the world was being cut off piece by piece. One day, there appeared a wall at the
    edge of the forest. A wall that looked just like those in the room we were just in. Just a gray wall that seemed to extend in all directions. The
    next day the wall grew closer. People were scaried. Long story short, eventually the whole world shrank to a single room. I don't know were the
    other people went, i haven't seen them in a while. I have no idea how much time i've been in that gray room, alone. But now you're here, and that
    probably means something is happening. Now, let's go for a walk at least, shall we? I've been on this same spot for so long it feels like forever.
    I'd like to at least take a stroll through the forest while we can.
