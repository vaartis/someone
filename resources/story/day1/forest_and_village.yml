    Well, you did something, and now there's the forest. That is what i was talking about when I told you that there was more. This forest is
    a fraction of it. This is where we all woke up.

    There were. I don't know if they're still here. It's been some time since there was anything here. But now you're here at least. And the forest is
    back too.

    - text: Then what do you mean by "woke up"?

  char: narrator

    We all found ourselves here just like you did, with no memory of what happened or who we are. When I found myself here, there was nobody else
    around. It was pretty lonely, the only thing I would do is walk through the forest, looking around for anything to do at all. With time though, more
    people came, just like me, with no memories about anything before the moment they woke up. They found themselves in this very forest. They went
    looking for something to do, like i did, and eventually met the others. There were all kinds of creatures appearing, too. Some of them were very
    much sentient, like me and you, some were more animal-like, just following instincts. What seemed to connect them was that they all were just as
    confused.

    - text: So what happened? Where did everyone go?

    Something. I'm not sure what exactly happened, but it seemed like the world was being cut off piece by piece. One day, there appeared a wall at the
    edge of the forest. A wall that looked just like those in the room we were just in. Just a gray wall that seemed to extend in all directions. The
    next day the wall grew closer. People were scared. Long story short, eventually the whole world shrank to a single room. I don't know were the
    other people went, i haven't seen them in a while. I have no idea how much time i've been in that gray room, alone. But now you're here, and that
    probably means something is happening. Now, let's go for a walk at least, shall we? I've been on this same spot for so long it feels like forever.
    I'd like to at least take a stroll through the forest while we can.

    You walk through the forest you are now in. It's not very thick, but there is still plenty of plants and trees. Although all of them look somewhat
    similiar with small variation.

    - text: So.. what was life like here, anyway? Until everything diasppeared, that is..

12:
  char: narrator
  text: >-
    Oh you know, pretty peaceful. It's not like we had any specific needs to have fights for. I'd say just your usual life, but i can't really judge
    fairly what usual life is like, because i've only ever known my own life here...

    - text: True... I still want to know though.

    Well, after some time spent just going around the forest and finding other people, we decided to settle down somewhere. This is where we're
    currently heading, or so i hope, since i havn't seen this forest for such a long time. For some reason, there were some people that knew how to make
    "instruments", while others didn't. They couldn't explain where they obtained this knowledge, it's like it just appread in their heads when the need
    arose. These people would make these simple instruments from what was in the forest. It looked like they were just smashing things together and then
    the tools just appeared in their hands. Others tried to do this too, but would not succeed. Then the instruments were used to chop down the trees,
    uproot stumps, and build from that. Other people knew how to make dyes from flowers and other plants. They did it the same way others made
    tools. The first houses were pretty simple, but of course, as time went on people would make them more sophisticated and fancy, to stand out
    more. Eventually we learned how to make other things, too. Some people, who were not able to create anything by hand, would create for the sake of
    entertainment, some created paintring, others would use paper and black dyes to to write tales and stories. Some volunteered to document the history
    of what was happening around them, and with those people the libraries appeared. They'd organize their document history in books and store them all
    in one place. Sounds pretty cool, right?

  char: player
  responses:
    - text: Yeah, that's useful, probably?

16:
  char: narrator

    Maybe for the new people that come like you it would be. People here don't age, they were all around for as long as i can remember, until what
    happened happened and they were all gone. Anway, after sometime fire was discovered and the first library burnt down with most of the books in
    it. Some were rewritten from memory after that, but many were gone forever.

17:
  char: player
  responses:
    - text: Oh.

18:
  char: narrator
  text: >-
    Indeed. So the next library was built out of stone. Not long after that concrete was discovered by accident. Same happened with glass. Fast forward
    some time, and the village wasn't the only place where people lived, a city was built, and it was big, with asphalt roads and tall buildings. People
    would come up with different work for themselves to spend time. Now they were trying to understand the world itself. Trying to find out how things
    work. Eventually, a person showed up. They didn't name themselves, but claimed to be the creator of this world. They moved rather unnaturally, as if
    controlled by strings by strings. They told the researchers about the world about how that person watched them grow and that now they had come to
    them in person. A bit after that, the "creator" disappeared, and then the thing happened, the world was vanishing. Panic. And then everything ceased
    to be. Except me. I was still there, for some reason.

        That is one crazy story.. but i have no choice except to belive it. I have no idea what i am doing here exactly, so might as well take some
        explanation for granted, you really now a lot more about things than I do. Oh and by the way, you so confidently asked me if i'm sitting in front
        of a computer screen, how come you were so certain?

20:
  char: narrator
  text: >-
    There's something in the way you move that gives it away, it's a bit similiar to how the "creator" was. It might just be my imagination, I really
    wanted to belive that you had something in common with them, and it turned out you did. Anyway, we're there. This is the place where i used to live.

    You see something reminiscent of a village. There are a lot of cottages of all shapes and colors. No living creature seems to be around except the
    two of you. All the windows are dark, too. There is a central road around which all the houses seem to have been built. Or rather, probably, the
    road was made to connect the first houses and then the others were built along it.

22:
  char: narrator
  text: >-
    My house is the one on the edge of the road. Since my house was one of the early ones, it was built on the current outskirts of the
    village and I never really had any reason to move. The road was made a long time after it was built, connecting my house and the house of a friend
    of mine first, and then extending into the village.

    You come to the house <narrator> was talking about. The door is not locked, the <narrator> just opens it.
