    <narrator>: Well, you did something, right?

      Yeah. I did the most obvious thing: pressed the button that was the only other thing in the room except me and the computer.

    That was.. indeed a very obvious thing to do. Anyway, welcome to "the rest of the world". This is where we all woke up.

      "We all"? So there are more people here?

7:
  char: narrator
  text: >-
    There were. But I'm not sure there's anyone else besides us right now. Well, at least I'm not alone anymore..

      Oh.. and what did you mean by "woke up"?

9:
  char: narrator
  text: >-
    We all found ourselves here just like you did, with no memory of what happened or who we are. When I found myself here, there was nobody else
    around. It was lonely, the only thing I would do is walk through this forest, looking around for anything to do at all. With time, more people
    appeared, just like me, with no memories about anything before the moment they woke up. They found themselves here. They went looking for something
    to do, like I did, and eventually met the me and the others. There were other, more animal-like creatures appearing, less self-aware and more just
    following basic instincts. What seemed to connect everyone was that they all were just as confused.

  responses:

      And then.. could you elaborate on what happened? Where did everyone go?

11:
  char: narrator

    Something. I'm not sure what exactly, but it seemed like the world was being cut off piece by piece. One day, walls appeared on the far parts of
    the world, just like you saw before. They seemed to extend in all direcitons. The next day the walls grew closer. People were scared. Long story
    short, eventually the whole world shrank to a single room. Don't know were the other people are now, haven't seen them in a while. I have no idea
    how much time I've spent alone in that gray room. But now you're here, and that probably means something is happening.. Now, would you mind if we
    go for a walk? I've been on this same spot for so long it feels like forever. I'd like to at least take a stroll through the forest while we can.

    You are now walking through the forest. It's not very thick, but there is still plenty of plants and trees.

      So.. what was life like here? Until everything diasppeared..

15:
  char: narrator
  text: >-
    Pretty peaceful. It's not like we had any specific needs to have fights for. I want to say just usual life, but I can't really judge fairly what
    usual life is like to anyone else, because I've only ever known my own life here...

16:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      I don't think I have any idea how usual life is at all, so I'd like to hear how it was for you.

    Well, after some time spent just going around the forest and finding other people, we decided to settle down somewhere, we're currently heading
    there, I hope I remember the directions right, haven't seen this forest for such a long time.. Then, for some reason, there were some people that
    knew how to make "instruments", while others didn't. They couldn't explain why they knew it, it's like it just appread in their heads when the need
    arose. These people would make simple instruments from what was around in the forest. It looked like they were just smashing things together and
    then the tools just appeared in their hands. Others tried to do this too, but couldn't do it. Then the instruments were used to chop down the
    trees, uproot stumps, and build from that. Other people knew how to make dyes from flowers and other plants. They did it the same way others made
    tools. When the first houses were built, they were simple, but as time went on people would make them more sophisticated and fancy, to stand out
    more. Eventually we learned how to make other things, too. Some people, who were not able to create anything by smashing stuff together would
    create for the sake of entertainment, some created paintings, others would use paper and black dye to to write down history and daily life
    stories. The library building was built to store all the books that were written, all in one place, neatly placed on the shelves. And then the
    library burnt down by accident shortly after discovering fire. Sure the history books weren't all that useful, given that people here don't age,
    they were all around for as long as i can remember, until what happened happened and they were all gone. Still, many stories and hours of work were
    lost. They built the next library building out of stone.

      Oh.. So many books gone.. I guess the people learned their lesson about building from wood, though.. But still it really would have been great if
      it wasn't the library that burnt down. At least nobody got hurt I hope.

    Indeed a tragedy, but yes, nobody got hurt, so that's something good at least. Fast forward some time, and the village wasn't the only place where
    people lived now, there also was a city, and it was big, with asphalt roads and tall buildings. People would organize and come up with all kinds of
    things to work on. Now they were trying to understand and research the world around. Trying to find out how things work. Eventually, a person
    showed up. They didn't name themselves, but claimed to be the one who gave this world life, the creator. They moved unnaturally, as if controlled
    by strings. They told the researchers about the world, about how that person watched them grow and that now they had come to interact with them
    personally. A bit after that, the "creator" disappeared, and then the thing happened, the world was vanishing. Everything ceased to be. Except
    me. I was still here, for some reason.

      That is one crazy story.. but, really, I have no choice except to belive it. I have no idea what I am doing here exactly, so thank you for clearing
      a few things about this world up a bit, you really know a lot about it. Oh and by the way.. when you asked me if i'm sitting in front of a computer
      screen, how did you come up with that, what gave you the clue?

21:
  char: narrator
  text: >-
    There's something in the way you look and move that gives it away, it's a similiar to how the "creator" was. It might just be my imagination, I
    really wanted to belive that you had something in common with them, and it turned out you did. Anyway, we've arrived. This is the place where I
    used to live.

    You see a village. There are a lot of cottages of all shapes and colors. No living creature seems to be around except the two of you. All the
    windows are dark, too. There is a central road around which all the houses seem to have been built. Or maybe the road was made to connect the
    houses afterwards?

23:
  char: narrator
  text: >-
    My house is the one on the edge of the road. It was one of the early ones, built on what later became the outskirts of the village,
    never really had any reason to move from here. The road was made a long time after it was built, connecting my house and the house of a friend of
    mine first, and then extending into the rest of the village.
