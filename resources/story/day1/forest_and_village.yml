      What.. what happened to the room?

    Well, you did something, right?

  responses:
  - text: >-
      Yeah. I did the most obvious thing: pressed the button that was the only other thing in the room except me and the computer.

    That was.. indeed a very obvious thing to do. Anyway, what lies before you is "the rest of the world". This is where we all woke up.

      So there are more people here?

7:
  text: >-
    There were. But I'm not sure there's anyone else besides us right now. Well, at least I'm not alone anymore..

      Oh.. and what did you mean by "woke up"?

9:
  text: >-
    We all found ourselves here just like you did, with no memory of what happened or who we are. When I found myself here, there was nobody
    else.  The only thing I would do is walk through this forest, looking around for anything to do. Somehow, with time, more people
    appeared, just like me, with no memories. They found themselves here. They went looking, like I did, and eventually met the
    others. There were other, more animal-like creatures appearing, less self-aware and more just following basic instincts. What seemed to
    connect everyone was that they all confused as to how they came here.

      And then.. Where did everyone go?

11:
  text: >-
    Something happened. It seemed like the world was being cut off piece by piece. One day, walls appeared on the far parts of the world,
    just like you saw before. They seemed to extend in all direcitons. The next day the walls grew closer. People were scared. Long story
    short, eventually the whole world shrank to a single room. Don't know were the other people are now, haven't seen them in a while. I
    have no idea how much time I've spent alone in that room. But now you're here, and that probably means something is happening.. Now,
    would you mind if we go for a walk? I've been on this same spot for so long, it would be nice to at least take a stroll through the
    forest while we can.

      Sure, no point in staying here..

    You walk through the forest. It's not very thick, but there are still plenty of plants and trees.

      So.. what was life like here? Until everything diasppeared..

15:
  text: >-
    Pretty simple. It's not like we had any specific needs to have fights for. I want to say just usual life, but I can't really judge
    fairly what usual life is like to anyone else, because I've only ever known my own life here...

16:

  - text: >-
      I don't think I have any idea how usual life is at all, so I'd like to hear how it was for you.

    Well, after some time spent just going around the forest and finding other people, we decided to settle down somewhere. For some reason,
    there were people that knew how to make "instruments", while others didn't. They couldn't explain why they knew it. These people would
    make simple instruments from what was around in the forest. It looked like they were just smashing things together and then the tools
    just appeared in their hands. Others tried to do this too, but couldn't do it. These instruments were used to clean out the forest and
    build simple houses. Other people knew how to make dyes from flowers and other plants. They did it the same way others made tools. As
    time went on people would make them more sophisticated and fancy, to stand out more, or brag to others, or just to spend time. Some
    people, who were not able to create anything by smashing stuff together, would draw paintings, others would use paper to to write down
    history and daily life stories. The library was built to store all the books that were written, all nicely placed on the shelves. And
    then the library burnt down by accident shortly thereafter. Sure the history books weren't all that useful, given that people here don't
    age, they were all around for as long as i can remember, until what happened happened and they were all gone. Still, many stories and
    hours of work were lost. They built the next library building out of stone.

       So many books gone.. I guess the people learned their lesson about building from wood, though.. At least nobody got hurt?

19:
  text: >-
    A tragedy, but yes, nobody got hurt. After some time, the village wasn't the only place where people lived, there was a city, with
    asphalt roads and tall buildings. People would come up with all kinds of things to work on to spend time, fight the bordeom, understand
    how the world around is. Trying to find out how things work. Eventually, a person showed up. They didn't name themselves, but claimed to
    be the one who gave this world life. They moved unnaturally, as if controlled by strings. They told the people about the world, how they
    watched it grow and that they came to see it in person. A bit after that, the "creator" disappeared, and then it happened, the world
    vanished. Everything ceased to be. Except me. I was still here.

      I have no idea what I am doing here exactly, so thank you for clearing a few things about this world up a bit. Oh and by the
      way.. when you asked me if i'm sitting in front of a computer screen, how did you come up with that, what gave you the clue?

21:
  text: >-
    There's something in the way you look and move that gives it away, it's a similiar to how the "creator" was. It might just be my
    imagination, I really wanted to belive that you had something in common with them, and it turned out you did. Anyway, we've
    arrived. This is the place where I used to live.

    You see a village. There are a lot of houses of all shapes and colors. No living creature seems to be around except the two of you. All
    the windows are dark, too. There is a central road around which all the houses seem to have been built.

23:
  text: >-
    My house is the one on the edge of the road. It was one of the early ones, built on what later became the outskirts of the village. The
    road was made a long time after it was built, connecting my house and the house of a friend of mine first, and then extending into the
    rest of the village.
