    She finds the light switch on the left and turns the lights on.

    Surprisingly, the light still works. And don't ask how, I don't quite understand it myself.

    I knew some people who could explain it, but I'm unsure we'll be able to meet them any time soon. Now, I'm really tired from all this walking,
    spending your time in an empty room for so long doesn't motivate to move much. So.. there's only one bed and we'll have to share it, I hope you're
    fine with that, thought it's not like you have a choice. You can check out the rest of the house if you want, you'll probably be spending some time
    here.

    Decently sized, has a sofa in it. On the opposite side of the room there are several bookshelves packed with various books, from
    titles you can guess some of them are probably scientific or philosophical. There's also something what seems to be a computer on
    the table nearby, but you decide not to touch it for now. The window in the room faces the other house nearby.

    Not very big, there are a few cupboards that have dishes in them, others have some of the plants you've seen earlier, but dried. Most
    of the food on the kitchen seems to be plant-based, except in the fridge there's something that looks like milk, but you decide not to
    touch it, since it's not your house. Maybe you could inquire Narra about the food here later. Other than all the storage
    places on the kitchen, there's a table with a few chairs and a window that faces the forest you just came from.

    On the left, there's a moderately sized bathtub, near which there's a small shelf with some kind of soap and a sponge. On the right,
    there's a a small sink, with its own bar of soap. There's also a very small window near the ceiling, you can only see the dark sky
    through it. The bathroom floor and walls are made of stone-looking tiles, not wood, like the rest of the rooms. You check if the sink
    works, and sure enough it does. At first the water is very cold, but turning the knob on the faucet makes it warm or even hot.
