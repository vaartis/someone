    On the way back, you spend most of the time focusing on the road. The bikes make the journey quite a bit shorter. When you arrive, the
    sun has almost set and it's pretty dark. On your way to Narra's house you suddenly notice that the house on opposite side of the street
    has its lights turned on. You look at her. She looks at you.

      Is this your friend's house?

    Yes! Oh wow, can it be that he's there? That we aren't alone here? We have to check RIGHT NOW.

    You both abandon the bikes in the middle of the road and run up to the house. She knocks on the door a few times and carefully opens it.

    Hey?

    Behind the door, you see a guy, a bit taller than you and Narra are, that has shoulder length aquamarine hair, and
    is wearing glasses. He jumps back, producing a high-pitched yell.

    aaHHH!!

    Maj! Long time no see!!

    ah.. ha.. hi! i'm really lost.. since everything went down i can't remember much.. the panic, then darkness, and then i wake up in the
    forest this morning. i couldn't wrap my head around what happened, so i thought i'd just head back home, what else could i do? so here i was,
    alone.. which was scary.. so i just spent the whole day at home..

12:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    Oh wow.. That's a bit different.. but.. uh.. let's come in and not just stand here, eh?

13:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    ohh.. yeah! sure.. and who's the person behind you might be..? if you don't mind me asking..

14:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    Ah, that's <= state_variables.input_variables.p >. They're.. uh.. new here. Apparently they're from the "outside", like the "creator" was.

15:
  text: >-
    wow! never thought i'd meet someone like that ever again..

16:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Hello! While it's true i'm from the "outside", I don't know anything about that "creator" person, nor do I know anything about
      myself.. or anything outside the room I'm in, really..

  char: maj

  text: >-
    oh.. shame.. but still, welcome! let's head into the kitchen and have some tea at least, like Narra suggested, we shouldn't
    just stand in the doors.

18:
  char: description

  text: >-
    You all head to a room on the left, it's a medium-sized kitchen. You and Narra sit at the table, while Maj puts some water into the electric
    kettle, the water boils rather fast, and after a minute you all sit at the table with some tea, which is still too hot to drink, but already smells
    minty.

19:
  char: maj
  wait: true
  text: >-
    so, how have you been?

20:
  text: >-
    You said that you only remember darkness and then you woke up back in the forest, but it was very different for me. It has actually been
    a very long wait for me. All that was left of the world was a single room with gray walls, and nothing else, and that's where I was all
    that time. I'm a bit envious of you not having to experience that. I never want to stay alone with nothing and nobody else but
    myself. I'm glad you're back too now, it's been about a day since the world has returned back to normal.. well.. except all the
    people. <= state_variables.input_variables.p > helped me get out of that room by doing somethig on the outside. Something also
    changed this night, while I was asleep.

21:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Yeah.. There was some kind of a corridor, with a stupid puzzle. So I pressed a few buttons, a melody played, and that somehow brought back the
      city. And you, too, it seems. Looking forward to more changes like that in the future.

22:
  char: maj
  wait: true
  text: >-
    wow.. that is a lot to process.. first off, it's very sad Narra had to experience this. but that's behind you now, and everything's
    gonna be fine, right?

23:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    I.. sure hope so. There are still so many people missing.. But we'll try to get them back! We've been to the city with
    <= state_variables.input_variables.p > today, it's as empty as everything else, so we really just wasted a lot of time.

24:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    such a big city and nobody there too.. so we're the only people here..

25:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    We haven't found anyone else.. But seeing you now makes me excited! More people might be coming back soon..

26:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    oh I can't wait for that..! i already miss all the life around here..

27:
  text: >-
    We'll be progressing with that soon, I hope. In the meantime, <= state_variables.input_variables.p >, Maj was one of the people who
    designed the first computers around here! So you can ask something about them..

28:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Why didn't you want to go to the city with them and continue working on the cool stuff?

29:
  char: maj
  wait: true
  text: >-
    you see.. i really don't like big crowds of people and the city is ALL about that.. i get all anxious.. so i'd rather stay.. besides,
    the scientific community has grown a lot since the beginning and I'm sure they can go on without me.

30:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    Don't you belittle your part in that, you dummy! They wouldn't be able to make it like it is without your work, and you know it. You
    didn't really leave them for good with no news or anything, you still kept up with people from there, didn't you?

31:
  text: >-
    yes.. ok, ok, you got me. i don't really like to admit it, because it'd sound like I'm bragging. but enough about that, there's another
    interesting thing: we designed the computers with long range networking in mind, and put some big servers in places where they'd be
    needed and where we could connect computers to them and then connect the servers together. one of them is actually right here, in the
    basement of my house, i rarely go down there so it might be a bit dusty, but we can go see it.. if you're interested.

32:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Sure, I wanna see it.

    Since you all are already done with the tea, you all stand up, and wait for Maj to lead the way. However, he just moves his chair and you notice
    that there's a trapdoor underneath. He lifts it, then reaches inside to find the light switch and turns it on. He then steps on the ledder there
    and starts going down. You look as he goes down, it's not that deep down there, just a few meters. He waves at you, telling you can go down
    now. You climb down the ladder first, then Narra climbs after you.

      You know.. this really looks like the room I am in. I mean, on the "outside". Except yours is way better lit.

35:
  char: maj
  text: >-
    do you really spend all your time in an almost empty concrete box?

36:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      It's not like I have a choice..

37:
  char: maj
  text: >-
    anyway. here it is, this big boy handles all the communication between the village and the city.

38:
  char: description

  text: >-
    you look at the server. It's a rack filled with all kinds of boxes and wires, all blinking with different colors.

39:
  char: maj
  text: >-
    in the city, there are a few of servers like this once, since it's a lot bigger. the city is like a hub for communication.

40:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      I think I'm noticing a pattern here.

41:
  char: maj
  text: >-
    it only makes sense that the city would be the center of all things, doesn't it? so.. i wasn't sure about how to use the basement for a
    while, but this thingy here fit in quite well, and it doesn't take space in the house, plus it gets all the underground coolness.

42:
  char: player
  responses:
    - text: >-
        So it's not just me, it really is colder in here?

43:
  char: narra
  wait: true
  text: >-
    I've noticed, too.

44:
  text: >-
    yes! besides being underground, this place is also additionally cooled down artificially. otherwise it'd get pretty hot in here, this thing
    produces a lot of heat. there's not much to see other than the server, but i am proud of it and will take opportunity to show this setup to
    someone if they ask, albeit it might sound like bragging, it did take some planning to set up. now, let's get out of here, i'm feeling cold
    myself.

45:
  char: description
  wait: true
  text: >-
    You all get out of the basement in the reverse order. Maj closes the trapdoor and moves his chair back.

46:
  char: maj
  wait: true
  text: >-
    now, it's getting really late, i'd love to talk some more, but maybe we should continue tomorrow?

47:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    I'm actually suddenly very tired, probably because the trip, I just realized it. Didn't notice at first because I was so excited to see
    you! We'll probably head back to my place then, <= state_variables.input_variables.p > is staying at my house for now, until we maybe figure
    out else.

48:
  text: >-
    see you tomorrow, then!

49:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      I wonder what'll happen tomorrow.. and how today's night will go. On my side, the the computer screen just goes black for a while.

    we'll know sooner if we go to sleep sonner, haha.

    You and Narra leave the house and get back to her place, she takes a shower, and you both head to bed.
