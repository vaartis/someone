    Never seen these streets so empty, it was bright and full of people even at night. Not anymore. Didn't think they'd ever end up like
    this. Hope they'll be the way they were before someday, even though I didn't like it at the time, it's sad to see them so devoid of
    life.

    Let's go see this one. This club was a hugely popular place to hang out at night, I got invited to go there at night a few times, but
    after the first one I didn't want to go there any more at all, too crowded.

      Shouldn't it be closed during the day?

  text: >-
    They didn't close it for the day, it's just that there weren't a lot of people there. That was the sweet time for me to go enjoy a few
    drinks.

    You go throuth the glass doors of the parade entrance, then through the long hallway, and to the actual dancefloor and the bar.
    As expected, there's nobody there.

    You come over to the bar. There are a few drinks on the bar.

      Uhm.. if nobody else is here, we might as well have them, right?

    You sit on the stool and take one the glasses, then have a sip. It's very, very sweet and has a slight strawberry flavor

      Yuck.. it's so sweet!

bar-6:
  text: >-
    Yes! This one's called "strawberry boom", because it's so sweet. But the aftertaste is nice.

    The one I have here is a mix of milk and various syrops. It's not exactly a thing you'd get at the club, more like a cocktail. Wanna try
    it?

    You take a sip of the cocktail. It is, indeed, a mixture of milk and various sweet syrops, although the which exact ones you can't quite
    figure out.

    The tiles of the dance floor don't change colors. It seems like the program that controls them doesn't run during the day.  There are a
    few tables around it, one of which has a small white pack of someting, with "6" written on it.

dance-floor-2:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Any idea what this pack is?

dance-floor-3:
  text: >-
    Oh that one.. It's probably the popular bubble-gum. Yeah it's called "6". Because there are 6 of them in the pack.

dance-floor-4:

  text: >-
    You come up to the table and peek into the pack. There are 5 strips of gum in there.

dance-floor-5:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Five. They left an almost full pack here. What a waste.

dance-floor-6:
  text: >-
    Maybe someone didn't like 'em. They don't exactly taste like.. anything. Just dull.

dance-floor-7:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Not too fancy of a gum, eh?

dance-floor-8:
  text: >-
    Yep. It's very basic. If you want to just chew on something, maybe, or have no time to brush your teeth at all, although.. I'm not sure
    it helps with that?

    That was a whole bunch of nothing, huh? I'm getting really desperate for something to change already! Come on.. Did we go all the way
    for nothing?

  responses:

      Yeah.. Jeez. So boring! Maybe we should head back already?

9:
  text: >-
    Come on, let's check a few more places, OK? And on our way, let's try to find a few bicycles to go back on, that should ease our way a
    bit.

      Oh, sure.. If you know where to get them.

11:

    Yeah. We'll head for the big mall for now, there's a bike place there, I hope nobody is going to mind if we take them.

12:
  responses:

      There's probably nobody to do so..

    Yes. That's what I'm talking about.

    You walk for bit more deeper into the city, until you see the big mall building. You know it's a mall because it has "City Mall" written
    on it.

    I'll try to remember where exactly the bike place is, while you look around and see if there's anything interesting while we're on the
    way. This place is pretty big.

    While you go, you notice a few clothing places, cosmetics stuff, lingerie, a huge food section, general applience stuff, and then,
    finally, you're at the bike place.

    Well, just take the first one that fits you and let's go already.

    She tries out a few bikes, stopping on a sporty looking green one. You grab the first one you see, the seat feels alright and the pedals
    are at the comfortable height, so you don't hesitate too much. Your bike is red, the best color. You set out on your way back
    immediately. The sun seems to already be setting. Just how much have you been walking here?

    What a disappointment. Not like it really matters, since the time is not a constraint, but still, it's disappointing. Now we know
    there's probably nothing there, at least.

      I guess that's true.. That wasn't very exciting, except when we actually did find something, you know?

    Not a lot of that, but yes..
