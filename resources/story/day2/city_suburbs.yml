    Finally, after the long walk, you arrive. Judging by the position of the sun, it's somewhere around noon. The stone road you've been
    walking gradually changes to asphalt.

    We're here, finally! That was hell of a walk. I guess we could just keep going on the road and not the sidewalk, since, presumably,
    there's no transport on the roads right now.. We're in the suburbs currenly, so the buildings here are mostly houses.
