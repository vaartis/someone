    It seems like it's already morning and Narra is already out
    somewhere. After a bit of searching you find her in the kitchen
    having breakfast.

    Hey. Morning.

  responses:

      Yeah..

  text: >-
    Slept well?

5:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Not really. When I "went to sleep" the screen went black and I was unable to do anything. So I figured I'll go
      look around again. Unsurprisingly, there was a new place to look at. Nothing too interesting though, three buttons
      that, when pressed so that they all become green, play a melody. And then I went back to the computer and it was
      already morning.

6:
  text: >-
    Sounds like someone's playing with you.

7:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      These buttons make no sense at all.. Why would someone engineer such a mechanism to just play a simple melody?

8:
  text: >-
    No idea. Though it might have done something more than just playing a melody, something less obvious.

9:
  responses:

      Did you notice anything change here, maybe?

10:
  text: >-
    Nope. Not yet, at least. I've been here in the house just as you were, though I did get up a bit earlier. Finally
    slept on a bed, too, haven't had that priveledge in a while.

11:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      No bed here in the room I'm in. It's quite empty actually, just me and a table with the computer. Well, there's this new hallway, but it's empty
      too, besides the buttons near the end of it. There really isn't anything of interest here besides the computer, which is also the only source of
      light here, otherwise it's dark as hell. Well, maybe also me, but that's only if someone is looking for company. And I don't think
      there's anyone else here.

12:
  text: >-
   Scary. You sure there's noone else there?

13:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      I dunno.. There's simply no place to hide in the two empty rooms. Maybe I'm missing the full picture, maybe this is all just a big joke, and you're
      in on it too.

14:
  text: >-
   I'm not. Or at least I'm not aware of it.

15:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Hope I can trust ya.

16:
  text: >-
    Hope I can trust myself.

17:
  responses:

      Fair. Now, about this room.. The screen of this computer is taking care of darkness around, but it's not that
      bright, hope I can find something to brighten this place up in the future.

18:
  text: >-
    Yeah, even if you're actually alone and not afraid, sitting in the darkness doesn't do you any good.

19:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Yep.. Now, what is this you're having for breakfast?

    She seems to have something that looks like cereal with milk in the bowl.

21:
  text: >-
    The liquid in the bowl is a product of soaking and grinding a plant that grows in another region, far from here. It was discovered in an expedition
    to a place outside the known land of that time. When they were there, they found a different biome, a colder one. The reports said that it was a
    chilly out there and that the plants and trees there were different. They took some samples back, then the local people discovered various
    applications for them. One of which was to use them as food, because of their taste. You see, we don't really need food to survive. We don't feel
    hunger. But we do feel the taste, and that is what food is used here for. Want to taste it?

    She passes you the carton.

      Yeah, I'm feeling curious.

24:

    You take a sip. It tastes like milk with a slight bit of grass.

25:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      This taste reminds me of a certain drink I know about for some reason. This seems to be a reoccuring pattern,
      too.. I know about something, but can't remember where I got that knowledge.

26:
  text: >-
    Usual for this place, if you ask me.

27:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Well, that logic might apply to you, but I'm here and you're there, it's a bit different.

28:
  text: >-
    Indeed. You'll have to figure it out in some other way.

29:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      So.. What about the other part of your meal?

30:
  text: >-
    Oh, it's the leaves of a bush growing around, people have been using it as food for a long time. When dried, it
    changes its taste, and some people like it more in that state. I do, for example. Do you wish to taste this too?

31:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Since we're on it, yeah i'll take a bite.

32:
  char: description
  wait: true
  text: >-
    You take a few from the box and taste them. It's really just dried leaves.

33:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Uh I dunno about this one. Really, it tastes like leaves.

34:
  text: >-
    That's because they are leaves?

35:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Yeah. I just thought it'd be something more surprising.

36:
  text: >-
    Sorry to disappoint! I like it, though. Now, let me finish my breakfast and we'll go take a stroll outside.

37:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Sure, take you time.

38:
  char: description

    You spend a few minutes in the kitchen while she finishes her breakfast.

39:
  text: >-
    Well, I'm done.. Let's go.

40:
  char: description
  wait: true
  text: >-
    You go outside. She turns the lights off as she closes the door. She then look somewhere behind you with a confused
    look.

41:
  char: narra
  text: >-
    Ah. This wasn't here yesterday. Might be the result of you solving that "puzzle" you talked about.

42:
  char: description
  text: >-
    You turn around and see that in the distance, there are now tall buildings.

43:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      So this is the city?

44:
  text: >-
    Yep, that's the one.

45:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Let's check it out, shall we?

46:
  text: >-
    Sure, if you don't mind the long walk.

47:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      It's not like we're short on time.. If I were to describe how much time we have, I'd say we've got all of
      it. Besides, not like there's anything else to do. Boredom really is a big problem around here.

48:
  text: >-
    Oh yes, it very much is. So, there was a stone road that leads from here to the city. It was layed a bit after the city was started, to make
    the path through the woods easier. It starts out there, on the other side of the village.

49:
  char: description
  text: >-
    After a short walk, you are on the stone road.

50:
  char: narra
  text: >-
    Here it is.

51:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Let's go, then. And if you don't mind, may I ask a few more questions?

52:
  text: >-
    Sure. What do you want to talk about?
