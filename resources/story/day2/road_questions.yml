    Yes, we do! I actually have one, too. You might've seen it in my living room. I got it recenly before everything disappeared, though now
    it feels like it's been forever. I used to have a bigger one, until it eventually broke down, probably from being so ancient, just
    refused to boot.. So I got a new one. Couldn't get the same one, they didn't make them like that anymore, I really got used to it, you
    know. So I got a new one. It was faster, but really, I didn't care much. I'm not very good with computers anyway, and I don't do
    anything complicated. Checking mail and blogging was good enough for me. We had a network that connected all computers together, making
    remote communication really easy.

    Oh all the things, daily happenings, just sharing your status with friends, you know? So you don't loose touch. I was happy when I was
    told about it, there were people I knew that moved to the city on there. So i started using it a lot. Of course, now that everyone's
    gone, there is probably nobody on there..  We could still check it later when we get back. Or maybe we could find some kind of public
    computer in the city.

    Yes? Well, we wouldn't eat each other, would we?

      Fair.. Here we have other foods, which are made of various creatures that are deemed not self-aware enough. People would raise them specifically
      to cook them later. I can't remember why, but I know that it exists and how it happens..

food-3:
  text: >-
    That sounds pretty awful.

food-4:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      It does, kind of. But these creatures live their best lives before they are made into food. They're well fed and cleaned. I can't say
      I'm too much against that, especially if they really don't even recognize themselves, just follow the instincts.

food-5:
  text: >-
    While I can understand that, we never really sank that low as to abuse the less aware creatures.

food-6:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Yeah, I guess some of the reasoning for that would be that people in your world don't actually need to eat to survive. Eating other
      creatures gives way more nutrients. Maybe that was the main reason people eat them: to survive the tougher times. I'm sure there are
      people out there that are against that.

food-7:
  text: >-
    In that case, it does make sense that people would use any means necessary to survive of course. Still, I'm glad that for us this
    problem never existed and we could circumvent it entirely and don't have a dire need to abuse creatures to survive and it makes me feel
    unwell that this had to happen in your case.

      Again, surely there must be other people that feel like you out there. Although I bet the opposite is also true, there might be people
      that enjoy it.

    What an awful world that must be. Still, surely, not all hope is lost if someone understand that it's bad.

    Pretty much. Since I woke up here my appearance didn't change at all. The hair and the nails grow, but that's practically it. So Ib still have to
    look after them, but except that.. not much changes. You can get new clothes to change your looks a bit, certainly, but other than that the looks
    don't change too much. Some people actually wondered if anything could be done about that, but the research was started just recently and didn't
    go that far.

      I see.. Were all people here uh.. grown-ups?

age-3:

    Not all of them, no. The "age" ranged considerably, there were all kinds of people. You couldn't really judge anyone by their
    appearance, because someone could look like a child, but have lived a long life already. Perhaps, we could talk to the people who did
    research on the topic, provided we'd find someone like that. Maybe in the city, since most of them lived there, it was the place for
    researchers to gather.

    Uhm.. It's big! And it had a lot of people doing many things. A lot bigger than the village, you know. The buildings there were also
    actually built in regions designated for them, unlike in our village, where things were just made up as the time progressed and then
    were connected with a road. For the city, they actually planned areas for houses and for service and entertainment buildings, which
    where then built there gradually as the amount of people and ideas of what to build raised. In the housing areas, the houses were made
    with multiple floors and flats, to allow more people to live in those houses; and in the center of the city there is a lot less of
    housing and a lot more of the fun stuff like clubs, cafes, restaurants. Plus, since the city is so big there are also means of easier
    transportation between the parts of the city. Although they wouldn't help us since they require someone to operate them and I sure as
    hell have no idea how to do it. We can probably see some of them standing motionless though.

      Interesting.. What about nighttime, how's it at night?

city-3:
  text: >-
    It'd be all lit up if there were people, night life there is a normal thing there, unlike in the village where we mostly go to bed and
    get up early; in the city, many people are more active at night, just because of the way they made their schedule; there are
    entertainment places where they go to meet their friends and make new ones, have a drink, dance. I tried that lifestyle for some time
    when I was in the city but I really just couldn't handle it, I think it takes a lot of time to get used to it; getting up so late just
    feels wrong.. and staying up after midnight is just too tiring for me..

    Precicely. The food there is made of things gathered there from different places. Since they don't have much of their own food
    production, they have to get it from all the places around the world, while the rest of the world gets the "techonolgy" pieces from
    them, like computers and phones. As a consequence, you can also get food from other parts of the world there for yourself if you go to
    the city. The milk I had for breakfast, for example, I got from my last trip to the city.

    It's not really the ONLY one. There are kinds made from other things. It's just that since this one was discovered first, it got the name, and
    only after that did people tried experimenting with other things. Not all of those experiments were that successful..

    I hope we won't have to.. We got up pretty early and the day is still young, so there's a good chance we won't. Still, if we have to,
    we'll probably be able to stay at some kind of hotel, especially if there's nobody else there besides us. There are a few of those in
    the city, so finding one wouldn't be a problem. They were made especially for people like us, who come to the city for a short time and
    don't have any other place to stay at.
