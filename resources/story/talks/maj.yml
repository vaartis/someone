    I guess you guys have all kinds of tea here, since you're so big on all the herbs and flowers..

    even though i drink tea all the time, really i just take whatever tea i can find. preferably as much of it as i can get.
    i could be picky but why bother? it's all damn good.

    yeah! obviously people wanted to use their computers on the go,
    so when we learned how to make them small enough, we were able
    to put the whole thing into this small case. best invention since
    stationary computers!

      When we were in the suburbs with Narra, we uhm.. broke in one of the flats..
      Well, not exactly broke in, it wasn't locked! Of course, there was nobody there,
      but a laptop. It looked similiar to yours.. and it wasn't even protected at all, too..

    they all look the same except for color and a bit of changes in the newer models, since they're all
    made by the same people. many people don't care much about putting passwords on their computers, though
    it's a bit more rare to see that in the city, i gotta admit.

    other? what?

      There are.. older versions of this world. I can't affect them in any way, because they've been "archived",
      and after I leave everything returns to how it was. I only saw Narra there, too, in a room like she told
      you about yesterday.

    i see.. surely it's not a coincidence. they must've been some kind of failed states if they got.. dumped like that.
    it must've been a hard choice between killing the world and leaving it hanging like that forever.

      It seems so, and the one who did it left notes about why they did it, too. Maybe their memory wasn't too good or something,
      if they had to write down something like that. As for their choice, well.. let us hope we find out more about it.
