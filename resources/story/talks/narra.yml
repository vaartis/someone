      Yeah, I'm actually eating right now. It's a can of peaches, there's actually a fair amount of different canned foods here.
      Tastes alright, probably not as good as fresh ones, though.

    So, where'd you get them? I had the impresssion there weren't too many places to store food.

      There were a few new rooms I found today, one of them was just full of canned foods. A big room with a lot of shelves filled with
      cans. Noticably, a fair amount of shelves was empty.

      The room's ceiling wasn't too high, but who knows how high it actually goes. On the way there I passed over
      a bridge and the sky above was visible, it seemed pretty far away. And below, well.. it'd be a long fall.

      Not a copy. You share appearence, but you are different people, whose personality depends on the life you lived.
      And her world certainly didn't exist for as long as yours. And now that it's "archived", it seems like nothing new can be added
      to it.

      Yes, like here.. They tried just eating plants and berries but it didn't quite work out it seems.. So they started fighting for food.
      Though.. it didn't affect their version of you it seems, she couldn't understand what was happening to them. Things just went too fast
      for her to do anything..

    That explains why we don't have that need..

instance-hunger-4:

      I learned how to get to that.. world.. from a note I found.. It said that things didn't work out well, just like "other things" didn't.
      So there must be more than this one.. then.. and one of them is yours, the latest one. I would imagine it's the latest one at least,
      since you were here when I woke up, and things seemed to be going well for you.

instance-hunger-5:
  text: >-
    A note, you say.. and you think there are more? Well.. Look out for them.. I hope we'll be able to do something.. To keep them like that
    is just cruel, they're just as much of a person as.. whoever did this.
