    You're standing in the same gray room you've seen before already. You see Narra in the corner of the room, sitting on the floor,
    looking up, onto the ceiling, unaware of your presence.

    Do you know where everyone is..? They were acting all strange, fighting each other, yelling they're in pain from..
    not eating? We tried gathering plants and berries for food, but it wasn't enough for them! First, they started fighting
    for the plants, then they started biting each other! And then.. I was here. And everyone was gone. It's.. been a while since
    I've seen anyone. Do you know what happened?

      It's a.. a machine that can do basically anything.. Like having a whole world inside.. What I mean is.. This isn't really "real".
      At least.. it's not the outermost layer of reality.. I'm not sure how to say it. As far as I'm aware, you're
      in this computer I found when I woke up! And.. well, nobody has told me I'm not real yet, so it would be fair to assume
      there is nothing outside of my reality. I'm sure you're as real of a person as I am.. but..

9:
  text: >-
    What?! What do you mean not real?! This is all I ever knew.. How.. how..? What's outside, then? Why am I here?
    Can you get me out?!

10:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      It's shocking, I know.. And outside.. well.. I don't really know myself. I woke up in a room, just like you woke up in the forest,
      with no memories of what happened. It's really dark here. And I'm alone, except for the this computer.. inside of which there are people
      like you. Real, thinking and talking people, but at the same time not quite.

11:
  text: >-
    Wait, how did you know I woke up in the forest?

12:
  responses:

      I saw.. a different version of you. She lived for a while. Quite a long time, probably.. With many people, and mostly without trouble..
      It went to the point where they had their own computers! And.. well, at some point they discovered that they weren't.. "real" too. They were
      told by someone, apparently someone who made all of this.. And shortly after, their world was made like yours, a single room with only you..
      I mean, her. However, I was somehow able to restore it, though only you were there at first. Some things happened afterwards, but that's the
      gist of it.

13:
  text: >-
    A.. different me? How.. is that possible? What the.. Can you.. help me too? Like you helped her? I don't want to stay here anymore..

14:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      I don't think I really can.. not intentionally.. I was able to help her just accidentally.. Or it seemed accidental.. I didn't quite do anything,
      just pressed a button!

15:
  text: >-
    Wha.. oh.. How.. how do I live with this now? Why did you tell me? WHAT DO I DO NOW?

16:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      I don't think you'll have to.. This.. menu.. on the computer. It said that your world is.. in an archive? And that it's "read only"
      I think that means you won't remember any of this. When I leave, everything will reset to how it was.

17:
  text: >-
    What.. Can you.. not leave? I don't want to be alone.. Though.. if I forget all of it.. It doesn't matter? Will I still exist? Or.. this is
    confusing..

18:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      I'm sure you'll still be you.. just.. you won't remember anything that just happened. I will try to find a way to get you out of this room.
      Though I don't know how yet.
