    You find yourself in the same grey room. You see Narra walking around the room, not paying any attention to you, or perhaps not noticing
    you at all. After a few seconds she finally notices you and stops.

    Hey. Haven't seen anybody here in a while. Any idea where they went?

      I already told you, but you forgot. When we talked last time, you asked me to not be angry about it. You really don't remember, do you?

    Not a thing, this is the first time I see you. But, you know.. I'd like to know more about this situation.

      This note I found was talking something about archiving and not going anywhere.. I guess this "archiving" thing is why you're in this
      room.. Should probably mention that your world isn't exactly as it seems, though maybe you'd figured it out already. I won't go into
      details, but the main point is: it's simulated, not real, except for you, I suppose. And it has been archived, and replaced with a
      new one, maybe even more than one.

    Not real, you say.. Yeah, probably. No way all this beauty could have been destroyed like that in the real world, right? Did they
    destroy it because they thought it wouldn't "go anywhere"? I don't even know what to say. Couldn't we just keep enjoying our lives?  Not
    all things have to "go somewhere". Everything was so simple, just strolling around, sleeping under the trees, keeping each other warm at
    night..

  responses:
  - text: How long did you enjoy this life?

7:
  text: >-
    I don't know.. Many days. We had no need to track time, and really, we couldn't. Never even thought about this, we didn't even have any
    way to preserve the information besides remembering it.

8:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Didn't have any way of preserving it? I think the note mentioned that.. That's probably what they meant by not "going anywhere". You
      didn't have any motivation of doing anything, or inventing anything.. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's how you lived
      all your life.. Doesn't explain why they'd just destroy everything like that, though. But this is probably not the first time this
      happened to a world like yours.

    Now, of course, this room isn't a beautiful forest, but really, I haven't been doing much either way, I can still move around a bit..
    No tree to sleep under, and no sun or moon to know whether it's day or night, but with time I sort of got over it. It's a bit lonely here,
    but I can just sleep all day if I want.. Now, you go and figure out why they did this, all right?

10:
  responses:
  - text: >-
      Of course. Though.. I don't think you'll remember all these things I've told you.. It says here "read-only", so you'll probably just
      forget about me when I leave.

11:
  text: >-
    A shame, but really, we've got all the time in the world. Please don't be angry at me not remembering you and just explain this stuff
    again, OK?

  responses:
  - text: "Yes, of course."
  - text: "I suppose I'll have to explain it again next time."
  - text: "Of course I won't be angry. I already told you."
