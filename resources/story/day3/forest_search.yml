    the forest where people wake up, maybe we could go straight to that spot.

    Sure, there are a few other places there where we could look. There's a meadow where people would gather in the
    evenings and overnight to camp and sit by the fire. Then there's the spring where someone goes when they need water
    but are far from home. The other thing that comes to mind is the entrance to the caves, nobody really goes there but
    it's a good place to hide from the rain or the sun.

    Up there, where the caves are, the water comes down to here. There, it comes out from somewhere up on the
    mountain.. Since it's quite a long way to the caves, people come to this spot, where the flow is relatively clear,
    when they need some water.
