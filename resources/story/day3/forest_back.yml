    We've already seen what you've said about your experience, it matches exactly with what Maj told..

    Oh, I wasn't the only one, then. Are there any more people who share this experience?

4:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    We don't know. Presumably, everyone else, because everyone is gone. Maj woke up like you yesterday and
    we met him at home, after we went to see if anything was different in the city. It wasn't, there was nobody
    there too..

    Wait.. Everybody is gone? Are we the only people here now? What happened to everyone?

    Yes, everyone.. We don't know exactly what happened< if lume.any(state_variables.talks.narra.instances) then >,
    though I think we may get to know more about that in the near future< end >. What we know is that <= state_variables.input_variables.p >,
    our friend here, is probably able to help, as they are from the.. outside.

    Outside? Hard to believe this is really happening again..

    I assure you, that's how it is. You'll have to trust me on this.

      I'm alone in front of a computer in a dark room with gray walls. There are a few other rooms
      that have appeared but they're not much different from this one.

    That does sounds like no good.. And Narra said you can help us?

    Some things out there seem to result in changes in our world. While for you, it probably felt like you lost
    consciousness and woke up immediately, that's not what happened to me. I've been trapped in a room, similiar to the
    one <= state_variables.input_variables.p > described, for a very long time.. Hard to measure how long. Then,
    <= state_variables.input_variables.p > just.. appeared and after pressing some kind of button there, on the outside,
    we both found ourselves back in the forest. Similiar things happened the next nights, something triggered changes on the outside,
    and in turn the world reacted and changed something outside, opening opportunities for <= state_variables.input_variables.p > to..
    find out more. First, the city appeared, and with it Maj came back, though we only found him in the evening, when we came back.
    Now you're back, too.

  text: >-
    This story is just so bizzare.. I can't believe everyone just disappeared like that.. and that you spent so much time
    waiting.. It's just a lot to take in, sorry.. Who could have done this?

15:
  wait: true
  text: >-
    < if lume.any(state_variables.talks.narra.instances) then >
    Someone out there. We don't know why this happened, but there are other worlds like ours who experienced something very similiar.

    We don't know yet.

    Yes.. I know, once again, it's hard to beleive.. But as <= state_variables.input_variables.p > has discovered, we
    aren't the first ones.  There were people before us, whose world were similiarly restricted to a single room,
    where.. only I remained. Not me you see before your eyes in person, but.. another me. Moreover, after
    <= state_variables.input_variables.p > it seemed like all their interactions were erased after <= state_variables.input_variables.p >
    left.

    The rest of they way is spent in silence. Kipi's face shows she is thinking about something. When you reach the village,
    all of you head to Maj's house. Kipi knocks on the door.
