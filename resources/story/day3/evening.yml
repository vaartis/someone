      You all come in, unsurprisingly finding Maj in the same spot as yesterday. He is visibly surprised when he sees Kiki.
      Everyone sits at the table with Maj, as he closes his laptop.

    I'm inclined to believe that's what happened. That's what Narra told me and, well.. that seems to be the case indeed. I woke up in the
    forest and Narra and <= state_variables.input_variables.p > met me there.

  char: narra

    We went searching into the forest and.. well, we were lucky, I guess. Though Kiki would've gone home by herself already, probably.
    We had some time to catch up on the way back. I told her the whole story.

    It's still hard to believe but I think I'm over it now.

      so.. same thing happened to you, right? everything goes to black and you wake up in the forest?

8:
  wait: true

    Exactly. Surely this isn't a conincidence. We must find out why this is happening and find where all the other people are. Things like that
    don't just happen.

    i know, i know.. it's strange! but we will find it out eventually, i believe it.

    I hope so.

    Well.. I actually woke up because Narra was shaking me.. and then we went home, basically.

    After I woke up, I decided to walk around the forest a bit before going back and went to the meadow, I had no idea what happened at the time..
    And then I met Narra and <= state_variables.input_variables.p > there, and they told me..
    < elseif on == "spring" then >
    After I woke up, I decided to walk around the forest a bit before going back and went to the meadow, and after sitting there for a bit to the
    spring to get some whater, I had no idea what happened at the time.. And then I met Narra and <= state_variables.input_variables.p > there,
    and they told me..

    That's how my day was.

    We went into the forest in hopes of finding someone and we did! That's a great outcome for the day, honestly.
    Though we did spend basically the whole day on foot again..

    and i.. well, i spent my day mostly at home, as i usually do. went through all the long running software i had
    on the server, and all of it pretty much went down because for.. however long we have been missing, apparently
    the time on computer messed up and went negative.. needless to say, this wasn't supposed to happen for a very long time..
    most things didn't handle that well. i'm honestly surprised things didn't break down completely somehow.

    oh, far from it.. never really thought about this exact situation. hopefully i'll be able to fix this somehow and
    i have a few ideas in mind but i won't bother you with the technical details.

tech-details-1:
  char: maj
  text: >-
    well.. if you insist.. i think about introducing some kind of monotonically increasing time into the system and something to handle time
    leaps which may have happened, plus maybe somehow using arbitary sized numbers to allow keeping track of time past the current point, or
    maybe introducing some kind of epoch to start counting time from zero and not lose the time data from before.. things
    happened.. somehow. it's going to be a mess to handle all of this and make things work properly, especially while i'm alone on this
    task. but then again.. that's how it is with computers. i'm trying to work things out for now and then hopefully when there are.. more
    people to help, we're going to figure things out. it's better than doing nothing. uhm.. i hope you understood at least a bit of what i
    said.

    While we're at it.. What were you guys doing when.. it happened? I think I kind of missed everything.. I remember the news about the
    walls appearing and then I just kinda went on with my day, then they said the walls are growing closer and that's when I began
    worrying.. and then, well, you all know what happened. I can't quite remember what I was doing, but I think I was at home
    watering my plants.

21:
  char: player
  responses:
  - text: Oh, so that house with a bunch of plants is where you live?

  char: kiki

  char: maj

    well.. i can't it was any different for me. i was at home at the time too, but then i'm at home most of the time really..

24:
  char: narra
  wait: true
  text: >-
    As for me.. When the walls appeared, I took some time to go there and see them myself. Of course, it was as described,
    it felt surreal. The next days I checked them out too, and then.. well, somehow I was in the center of that small room.
    It's hard to explain, like suddenly everything around me shifted and I was suddenly there. Not a thing I'd ever want
    to experience again, and I wouldn't wish that for anyone.

25:
  char: kiki
  wait: true

    Your experience certainly differs a lot from ours..

    Indeed it does. On that note, it's getting late again.. I hope you guys wouldn't mind we go home now?

27:

  wait: true
  text: >-
    Not at all, I think getting a bit of sleep wouldn't hurt at all actually. With all these things to process, I need some rest.

28:
  char: maj

      You, Narra and Kiki all leave the house. Kiki wishes you both goodnight again and you go home.
      After a bath, Narra gets into bed, and so do you.
