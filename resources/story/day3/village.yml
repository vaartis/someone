    Well.. I'm gonna chill for a bit, all the yesterday's walking made my legs sore, haven't walked that much in a very long while.
    Maybe you could look around for a bit, just don't go too far.. I don't want you to get lost.. Come back a bit later and we'll try searching
    for more people together. Sounds alright?

    You walk, with a slow pace, in the general direction of the opposite part of the village.
    First, on the right you see a small, compared to the others, house, with an equally small veranda,
    some potted flowers growing on the railings and, looking through the window, some more flowers on the windowsill.

    Then, on the left, a colorful, normally sized house, contrasting the house across the street. The walls seem to be
    made of stone and painted yellow, and the roof is orange. The house has a veranda too, albeit it is empty except for
    a chair standing there, looking in the direction of where the sun would set. The windows don't have any curtains and
    you can see a bit of a room inside: the room is probably the kitchen, as a fridge can be seen from the window,
    standing right across the room, staring at the window.
  # This house looks like a square lemon with an orange put on top of it.

    Next, again on the right, there is another small house, with pastel pink colored walls, and pastel red roof. Unlike the
    other houses, this one doesn't have a veranda, and the house's foundation can't be seen from the outside, probably
    buried all the way in the ground.  The windows do have curtains: one of the windows is completely closed up with
    them, and the other one is half-closed, on the windowsill of the other half of the window you can see a few stuffed
    toys. One of them is shaped like a person with red hair, purple shirt and blue jeans, whose arms and feet are shaped
    like little beige spheres, the face can't be seen from this angle. The other one is something reminding of a person,
    yet you haven't seen something like that before before, it's light green, clearly has two legs and hands, but not
    sphere shaped, instead they limbs are all of the same diameter and have slightly lighter colored spots where hands
    and feet would be; it is wearing a dark-blue dress, the hemline of which is white; on its head it has black hair and
    pointy ears on top; as with the other toy, you can't see its face from this side of the window.

    The next house across the street is of very bleak yellow color, with a dark red roof. This house, too, doesn't have a veranda.
    The curtains on all the windows are closed, so nothing can be seen inside. What can be seen from the outside is the chimney coming
    out from the back of the house and rising up a bit higher than the roof.

    At this point, the road splits in two, one going straight and the other turning to the right. Narra asked you to no go too far,
    so that's the point where you turn back.

    You go back to her house, first checking the kitchen. She is however not in the kitchen, where you find her is the
    living room, lying on the sofa.

    Oh, hey. You're back and I'm rested for a bit, so I suppose we can go now.
